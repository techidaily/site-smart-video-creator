Denoted by x: y, where x is the width and h, is the height, an aspect ratio defines the shape of an image and can be different for different platforms and sites. Thus, one image with a certain aspect ratio might not fit perfectly on another site or a platform that supports a different aspect ratio. For instance, an image created for Facebook might not appear to be right in size when posted on Instagram. Similarly, an image seen on a smartphone will have a different look when watched on a big TV screen.</p>
<p>It is important to have the right aspect ratio as a set or recommended by the site or the platform so that they look appealing and interesting. To change ratio of image, there are several tools available.</p>

<p>Cropping an image means to remove a portion of the image, either to hide something you don’t want the audience to see or emphasize different elements within the image. Just as Photoshop allows us to crop still images, Final Cut Pro X allows us to crop moving video clips, as you’ll learn in this article.</p>

<p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Crop GIF Images &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<ul>
<li>1920 x 1080 pixels</li>
<li>1920 x 1080 pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don’t like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.</p>
<p>I’ll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called “trimming”) and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called “cropping”). You get to pick which one works the best for you.</p>
<h4 id="TRIMMING"><a href="#TRIMMING" class="headerlink" title="TRIMMING"></a>TRIMMING</h4><p>Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.</p>

<p>For instance, here an image - courtesy of Pond5 (&lt;<a href="http://www.pond5.com>">www.pond5.com&gt;</a>). Let’s say that we want to emphasize the barn and not the sky.</p>

<p>Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.</p>
<p>NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.</p>

<p>If no other clip is below the trimmed clip, the background will be black.</p>

                ></p>
<p>But, it actually isn’t black, it’s transparent. If you put another clip below it, you’ll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.</p>
<p>Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.</p>
<h4 id="CROPPING"><a href="#CROPPING" class="headerlink" title="CROPPING"></a>CROPPING</h4><p>Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.</p>
<p>There are several ways we can choose to crop an image:</p>

<p>Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.</p>

<p>Cropping an image means to remove a portion of the image, either to hide something you don’t want the audience to see or emphasize different elements within the image. Just as Photoshop allows us to crop still images, Final Cut Pro X allows us to crop moving video clips, as you’ll learn in this article.</p>

<p>This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software.

<p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Crop GIF Images &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<ul>
<li>1920 x 1080 pixels</li>
<li>1920 x 1080 pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don’t like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.</p>
<p>I’ll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called “trimming”) and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called “cropping”). You get to pick which one works the best for you.</p>
<h4 id="TRIMMING-1"><a href="#TRIMMING-1" class="headerlink" title="TRIMMING"></a>TRIMMING</h4><p>Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop001.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>For instance, here an image - courtesy of Pond5 (&lt;<a href="http://www.pond5.com>">www.pond5.com&gt;</a>). Let’s say that we want to emphasize the barn and not the sky.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop002.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to click the icon in the lower left corner of the Viewer and choose “Crop.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop003.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>This displays the cropping tools in the Viewer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop004.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Click the Trim button to turn on Trim mode. (This article discusses Trim and Crop. I’ll cover the Ken Burns effect in a future article.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop005.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.</p>
<p>NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop006.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Drag other corners or edges to further trim the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop007.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>When you have trimmed the image the way you want, click the “Done” button in the top right corner to exit trimming mode.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop008.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>If no other clip is below the trimmed clip, the background will be black.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop009.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>But, it actually isn’t black, it’s transparent. If you put another clip below it, you’ll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.</p>
<p>Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.</p>
<h4 id="CROPPING-1"><a href="#CROPPING-1" class="headerlink" title="CROPPING"></a>CROPPING</h4><p>Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.</p>
<p>There are several ways we can choose to crop an image:</p>

<li>1920 x 1080 pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don’t like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.</p>
<p>I’ll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called “trimming”) and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called “cropping”). You get to pick which one works the best for you.</p>
<h4 id="TRIMMING-2"><a href="#TRIMMING-2" class="headerlink" title="TRIMMING"></a>TRIMMING</h4><p>Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.</p>

<p>Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.</p>
<p>NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.</p>

<p>But, it actually isn’t black, it’s transparent. If you put another clip below it, you’ll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.</p>
<p>Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.</p>
<h4 id="CROPPING-2"><a href="#CROPPING-2" class="headerlink" title="CROPPING"></a>CROPPING</h4><p>Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.</p>
<p>There are several ways we can choose to crop an image:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>

<li>Click the Crop icon, as we illustrated above</li>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Right-mouse click (or Control-click) inside the Viewer and choose</li>
<li>Type Shift+C</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop012.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>* In the Inspector &gt; Video tab &gt; Crop (this option provides the most precision, but is the least intuitive to use)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop013.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>If you selected any option except the Inspector, click the Crop button in the Viewer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop014.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.</p>
<p>Final Cut displays numbers at the top of the Viewer indicating how much the image has been cropped.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Reposition the frame by grabbing inside the rectangle and dragging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop016.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>When you are happy with the results, click the Done button in the top right corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don’t see it.</p>
<p>And, if you look closely, you’ll see that the cropped image is softer (blurrier) than the original and edges are more likely to be stair-stepped.</p>

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>To reset a cropped image back to its default settings, open the Inspector and click the small curved arrow to the right of the word “Crop.”</p>
<h4 id="SUMMARY-2"><a href="#SUMMARY-2" class="headerlink" title="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</h4><p>Trimming is used to hide portions of an image and superimpose it over another image.</p>
<p>Cropping is used to reframe an image, say from a medium shot to a close-up, but runs the risk of overly softening an image. The general rule is that cropping a little is OK, but don’t crop too much.</p>
<p>I use both these techniques frequently in my own editing.</p>

<p>Cropping an image means to remove a portion of the image, either to hide something you don’t want the audience to see or emphasize different elements within the image. Just as Photoshop allows us to crop still images, Final Cut Pro X allows us to crop moving video clips, as you’ll learn in this article.</p>

<p>* In the Inspector &gt; Video tab &gt; Crop (this option provides the most precision, but is the least intuitive to use)</p>

<p>If you selected any option except the Inspector, click the Crop button in the Viewer.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.</p>
<p>Final Cut displays numbers at the top of the Viewer indicating how much the image has been cropped.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"

<p>Reposition the frame by grabbing inside the rectangle and dragging.</p>

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>When you are happy with the results, click the Done button in the top right corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don’t see it.</p>
<p>And, if you look closely, you’ll see that the cropped image is softer (blurrier) than the original and edges are more likely to be stair-stepped.</p>

<p>To reset a cropped image back to its default settings, open the Inspector and click the small curved arrow to the right of the word “Crop.”</p>
<h4 id="SUMMARY-3"><a href="#SUMMARY-3" class="headerlink" title="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</h4><p>Trimming is used to hide portions of an image and superimpose it over another image.</p>
<p>Cropping is used to reframe an image, say from a medium shot to a close-up, but runs the risk of overly softening an image. The general rule is that cropping a little is OK, but don’t crop too much.</p>
<p>I use both these techniques frequently in my own editing.</p>

Why is the animation used in education?</h3><p>The Institute of Progressive Education estimates several reasons why animation helps children learn better. At an early age, the bright color and bold shapes of cartoons help us develop recognition, understand words, and even tell time.</p>
<p>As we grow up, animation triggers the centers of the brain that work best for visual learning. When we insert a moral into a cartoon, it is also more often remembered because of the visuals. It is like the difference between seeing a film and reading a summary of the film.</p>
<p>Educational Animation Software is the tool we use to help create educational animations. It is playing more and more of a role in the teaching world, the deeper we go into the digital age.</p>

What are the benefits of using animation in teaching and learning of science subjects?</h3><p>Animation allows students to develop their understanding by applying rational thinking to their imagination.</p>
<p>Educational Animation software has an especially important place in the teaching of science because it will enable children to understand what is going on at a microscopic level.</p>
<p>It does this by recreating things that cannot be seen by the naked eye. There was a study into this in the Journal of Life Science Education, which focused on cell biology education.</p>
<p>By showing cell mitosis in a cartoon, the teachers can communicate actions that they would never get to see.</p>

<p>This exposition audits writing applicable to every one of these standards and proposes viable ways educators can utilize these standards when using video as an instructive device.</p>
