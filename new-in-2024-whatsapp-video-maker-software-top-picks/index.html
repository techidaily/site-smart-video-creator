Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason.

Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p>

Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-1"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-1" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-1"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p>

<h3 id="Part-3-FAQs-About-Game-Download-Sites-2"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-About-Game-Download-Sites-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites"></a>Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites</h3><h4 id="1-Where-can-I-download-PC-games-for-free-2"><a href="#1-Where-can-I-download-PC-games-for-free-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-2"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-2" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-2"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p>

Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-3"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-3" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-3"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p>

<p>Stabilizo is another pick to stabilize shaky videos online for free. While the software also offers other services like a PDF converter and video compressor, the tool is famous for stabilizing videos recorded on different devices.</p>
<p>Usually, it takes a few minutes to work on the video, but it depends on the size of your footage and internet speed. If the video is recorded at a high resolution or you have slow internet, Stabilizo might take more than 5 minutes to do the job.</p>
<p>This is how the tool works:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the website and click the “Browse” button to select the video you want to stabilize.</p>

<p> Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.</p>
<h2 id="What-Are-Public-Domain-Images"><a href="#What-Are-Public-Domain-Images" class="headerlink" title="What Are Public Domain Images?"></a>What Are Public Domain Images?</h2><p> By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain</li>
<li>A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect</li>
<li>A photo was never the subject to copyright</li>
</ul>
<p> It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.</p>
<h2 id="How-and-Where-to-Find-Public-Domain-Images"><a href="#How-and-Where-to-Find-Public-Domain-Images" class="headerlink" title="How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?"></a>How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?</h2><p> A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images.

<p> Graphic designers and all other creatives in constant need of a fresh supply of public domain images don’t need a special introduction to Pexels.

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent source of high-resolution photos</li>

                ></p>
<p> Morguefile is a website that offers stock footage to its users, but some of the images can’t be downloaded for free. That’s why you must click on the Free Photos tab before you start searching for public domain images on this website. The website hosts nearly 400.000 photos, videos, and vector graphics, but you must make sure that a file you want to download is within the public domain before you download it.

Viintage</h4><p> Viintage is a gold mine for graphic designers as it grants them access to hundreds of vintage posters, book covers, and images.

<li>Information about the institution at which an image is kept</li>
<li>The source from which you acquired an image</li>
</ul>

<p> Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.</p>
<h2 id="What-Are-Public-Domain-Images-3"><a href="#What-Are-Public-Domain-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="What Are Public Domain Images?"></a>What Are Public Domain Images?</h2><p> By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain</li>
<li>A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect</li>
<li>A photo was never the subject to copyright</li>
</ul>
<p> It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.</p>
<h2 id="How-and-Where-to-Find-Public-Domain-Images-3"><a href="#How-and-Where-to-Find-Public-Domain-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?"></a>How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?</h2><p> A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Websites-for-Downloading-Public-Domain-Images-3"><a href="#Best-Websites-for-Downloading-Public-Domain-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Websites for Downloading Public Domain Images"></a>Best Websites for Downloading Public Domain Images</h2><p> We’ve searched the Internet and we utilized our results to compile a collection of the most reliable websites that grant its users access to vast numbers of public domain images.
