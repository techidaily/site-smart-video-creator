<p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p>
<p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p>
<h2 id="Price-comparison-between-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion"><a href="#Price-comparison-between-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion" class="headerlink" title="Price comparison between Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Price comparison between Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Final Cut Pro X Price</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.</p>

                      alt="FCPX price"
                ></p>
<p>During the 90-free trial, you can purchase your Final Cut Pro X, which comes with the Logic Pro built-in for $299, or try the Pro Apps Bundle for Education which has the Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, Compressor, MainStage, and Motion pre-installed for just $199, which gives you a direct and automatic update on purchase. Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p>
<p>Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.</p>
<p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Though it comes with no trial policy, recent updates and fixes show that LumaFusion can generally be a dominating app in the editing world.</p>
<p>Plus, you can always try Filmora for free, it’s popular among beginners and professionals!</p>

<p>Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.</p>
<p>However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion"><a href="#Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion" class="headerlink" title="Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Is LumaFusion worth it?</strong></p>
<p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p>
<p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p>
<p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

<p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p>
<p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.</p>

<p>During the 90-free trial, you can purchase your Final Cut Pro X, which comes with the Logic Pro built-in for $299, or try the Pro Apps Bundle for Education which has the Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, Compressor, MainStage, and Motion pre-installed for just $199, which gives you a direct and automatic update on purchase. Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p>
<p>Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.</p>
<p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p>

<p>Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>

<p>Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.</p>
<p>However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-1"><a href="#Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Is LumaFusion worth it?</strong></p>
<p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p>
<p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p>
<p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

<h2 id="Price-comparison-between-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-3"><a href="#Price-comparison-between-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Price comparison between Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Price comparison between Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Final Cut Pro X Price</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.</p>

Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p>
<p>Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.</p>
<p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p>

<p>Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Lumafusion interface"
                ></p>
<p>Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.</p>
<p>However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-3"><a href="#Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Is LumaFusion worth it?</strong></p>
<p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p>
<p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p>
<p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

<p>After that, move the red marker to the end of the scene, and repeat this again to cut the video into several fragments. If you want to cut off the unwanted parts, right click the video and choose “Delete”.</p>

Confused about different kinds of formats?

<p>If you have many such files, chances are that you need to edit MP4 videos.</p>
<p>Although various MP4 editors are available on the market, they are a little space-consuming in order to ensure good performance. Here I’d like to share a powerful and efficient MP4 editor that designed for beginners and hobbyists.</p>
<p>It’s Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor). With it, you’re able to trim, rotate, crop, merge MP4 files, as well as personalize your MP4 videos with rich text, filter and transitions. Moreover, after you finish MP4 video editing, you can directly share your creation on YouTube, Facebook, or save to any format you want.</p>

<p>When you’re taking a snapshot of someone or something and posting it to social media, you’ll need to decide if it’ll be a portrait or a landscape orientation. And that’s where the knowledge regarding the <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> comes in!</p>

<p>This post will dive into the rise of the phone aspect ratio vertical, including best practices on using <strong>phone ratio calculator</strong> and <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong> based on its final viewing platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, or broadcast.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="letterbox image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg"
                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="video aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Shoot-a-Vertical-Video"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Shoot-a-Vertical-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Shoot a Vertical Video"></a>Part 3 Tips to Shoot a Vertical Video</h2><p>Besides using the <strong>photo ratio calculator</strong>, we’d like to enlist some tips on getting started with your <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> shooting.</p>
<p>1 – High production quality is not essential</p>
<p>Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don’t be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.</p>
<p>2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions</p>
<p>Whether it’s <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong> or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.</p>
<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>
<p>5 – Capture Attention</p>
<p>Yes, you need to attract the audience and capture their attention within seconds. And, it’s the only or one of the best tricks t get your audience hooked for the long term. Don’t underestimate the significance of storytelling, and you can thus add them for creative looks.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone"><a href="#Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone"></a>Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone</h2><p>Are you looking to capture the video in the correct <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg"
                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone9.jpg"
                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-1"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-1"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="letterbox image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg"
                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

<p>1 – High production quality is not essential</p>
<p>Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don’t be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.</p>
<p>2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions</p>
<p>Whether it’s <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong> or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.</p>
<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>
<p>5 – Capture Attention</p>
<p>Yes, you need to attract the audience and capture their attention within seconds. And, it’s the only or one of the best tricks t get your audience hooked for the long term. Don’t underestimate the significance of storytelling, and you can thus add them for creative looks.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-1"><a href="#Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone"></a>Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone</h2><p>Are you looking to capture the video in the correct <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg"
                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone8.jpg"
                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone9.jpg"
                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-2"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-2"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="letterbox image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="video aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

<p>1 – High production quality is not essential</p>
<p>Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don’t be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.</p>
<p>2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions</p>
<p>Whether it’s <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong> or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.</p>
<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>
<p>5 – Capture Attention</p>
<p>Yes, you need to attract the audience and capture their attention within seconds. And, it’s the only or one of the best tricks t get your audience hooked for the long term. Don’t underestimate the significance of storytelling, and you can thus add them for creative looks.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-2"><a href="#Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone"></a>Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone</h2><p>Are you looking to capture the video in the correct <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg"
                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>

<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

<p>1 – High production quality is not essential</p>
<p>Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don’t be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.</p>
<p>2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions</p>
<p>Whether it’s <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong> or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.</p>
<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>
<p>5 – Capture Attention</p>
<p>Yes, you need to attract the audience and capture their attention within seconds. And, it’s the only or one of the best tricks t get your audience hooked for the long term. Don’t underestimate the significance of storytelling, and you can thus add them for creative looks.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-3"><a href="#Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone"></a>Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone</h2><p>Are you looking to capture the video in the correct <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg"
                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

But of course, the resources are endless and in case we have some information, we can easily access the free video editing platforms which give us the opportunity to edit our videos without undesired logos on them. In this case, we will be discussing 6 video mergers without watermark, and the way we can use them – the tools and features they offer, and how we can get the best out of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photos by Microsoft</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?"></a>How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?</h3><p><img

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Photos App</strong></p>
<p>Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a New Project</strong></p>
<p>Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Clips</strong></p>
<p>Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.</p>

<p>As for merging videos, much like Fastreel, Clideo is pretty straightforward. You just click on the mentioned tool, and then easily choose files you would like to combine – you can merge any amount of video clips there. Several files can be chosen at the same time, or they can be added one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will take you to the editor, where you can join the videos. It’s possible to rearrange the files, by using drag-and-drop until they’re in the desired order. You can also add images and set duration from them, add audio, change its length and volume. The last step is choosing the aspect ratio and clicking the Export button. You can watch the preview of your result and then click on Download if you are satisfied with the merged file.</p>

<p>To merge videos, you should choose the tool, then Get Started, and register and sign in first.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then click on New Project, choose a video format (the platform offers you the list of the most popular ones), and it will take you to the editor, where you start off by adding media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Drag and drop images or videos that you want to combine into a single video. You can also click to upload media files from your system or browse our Stock Media library for high-quality stock photos and video.

After you have previewed your video, you can click on the export button in the top right corner, and then, your merged video will be ready to be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online UniConverter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we introduced some online platforms and software for you to use if you would like to merge videos and combine them into one. These are: Fastreel, Free Video Cutter Joiner, Clideo, Typito, Online UniConverter, Wondershare Filmora. It’s up to you which one you would like to choose to merge your videos or edit them in any other way, but you can try either of them and choose to your own liking – even so, of course, there are some other video mergers worth considering, that we might mention in the coming articles. Before then, enjoy with free video editors, without watermark!</p>
<p>If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-1"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?"></a>How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Photos App</strong></p>
<p>Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a New Project</strong></p>
<p>Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Clips</strong></p>
<p>Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fastreel by Movavi</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastreel.com/" >Fastreel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop&#x2F;add multiple files right away.</p>

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.</p>

<p>Drag and drop images or videos that you want to combine into a single video. You can also click to upload media files from your system or browse our Stock Media library for high-quality stock photos and video. Then, you can put your video clips in order, and work on it, if you want to use different tools, such as: edit, crop, trim, or resize them, as well as add text captions, images, and transitions. After you have previewed your video, you can click on the export button in the top right corner, and then, your merged video will be ready to be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online UniConverter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.</p>

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we introduced some online platforms and software for you to use if you would like to merge videos and combine them into one. These are: Fastreel, Free Video Cutter Joiner, Clideo, Typito, Online UniConverter, Wondershare Filmora. It’s up to you which one you would like to choose to merge your videos or edit them in any other way, but you can try either of them and choose to your own liking – even so, of course, there are some other video mergers worth considering, that we might mention in the coming articles. Before then, enjoy with free video editors, without watermark!</p>
<p>If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-2"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?"></a>How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/merging-videos-photos-app.png"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Photos App</strong></p>
<p>Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a New Project</strong></p>
<p>Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Clips</strong></p>
<p>Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fastreel by Movavi</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastreel.com/" >Fastreel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop&#x2F;add multiple files right away.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-1.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-2.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free Video Cutter Joiner</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.freevideocutterjoiner.com/" >Free Video Cutter Joiner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – the name already explains it all by itself! This is a free video merger which will not add watermark on your video. The software needs to be downloaded, and contributes to quickly cutting and joining videos. Free Video Cutter Joiner has no size limits – it can cut and merge videos with large file sizes without any trouble, and speed of it to do so is quite fast. It supports several file formats, such as AVI, MPEG, WMV, 3GP FLV, MP4, WMV, MOV, VOB, etc.</p>
<p>So, once downloaded, you will see how user-friendly and straightforward the software is: it shows two of its features right away – video cutter and video joiner. You choose which one you are about to use – so, in our case, video joiner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-3.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, you should click the the “+” icon, which lets you add files from your PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, hit on the Join button, and choose Indirect Join. Hitting on Start Join will start merging all the uploaded videos, and, wait a little until the process has been completed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clideo</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clideo.com/" >Clideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the online platform that declares that it makes it super easy to edit all your video files, images and GIFs, and is totally free. It gives us the opportunities to: merge, compress, resize, cut, make, crop, speed, rotate, add music to, loop, flip, reverse, mute, filter, and adjust the videos. Add subtitles, make memes, create slideshows, etc. Therefore, it’s pretty rich in its tools and features.</p>
<p>As for merging videos, much like Fastreel, Clideo is pretty straightforward. You just click on the mentioned tool, and then easily choose files you would like to combine – you can merge any amount of video clips there. Several files can be chosen at the same time, or they can be added one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will take you to the editor, where you can join the videos. It’s possible to rearrange the files, by using drag-and-drop until they’re in the desired order. You can also add images and set duration from them, add audio, change its length and volume. The last step is choosing the aspect ratio and clicking the Export button. You can watch the preview of your result and then click on Download if you are satisfied with the merged file.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Then click on New Project, choose a video format (the platform offers you the list of the most popular ones), and it will take you to the editor, where you start off by adding media.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Drag and drop images or videos that you want to combine into a single video. You can also click to upload media files from your system or browse our Stock Media library for high-quality stock photos and video. Then, you can put your video clips in order, and work on it, if you want to use different tools, such as: edit, crop, trim, or resize them, as well as add text captions, images, and transitions.

<li><strong>Online UniConverter</strong></li>

<p>Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.</p>

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we introduced some online platforms and software for you to use if you would like to merge videos and combine them into one. These are: Fastreel, Free Video Cutter Joiner, Clideo, Typito, Online UniConverter, Wondershare Filmora. It’s up to you which one you would like to choose to merge your videos or edit them in any other way, but you can try either of them and choose to your own liking – even so, of course, there are some other video mergers worth considering, that we might mention in the coming articles. Before then, enjoy with free video editors, without watermark!</p>
<p>If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-3"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?"></a>How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/merging-videos-photos-app.png"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Photos App</strong></p>
<p>Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a New Project</strong></p>
<p>Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Clips</strong></p>
<p>Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fastreel by Movavi</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastreel.com/" >Fastreel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop&#x2F;add multiple files right away.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-1.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-2.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free Video Cutter Joiner</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.freevideocutterjoiner.com/" >Free Video Cutter Joiner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – the name already explains it all by itself! This is a free video merger which will not add watermark on your video. The software needs to be downloaded, and contributes to quickly cutting and joining videos. Free Video Cutter Joiner has no size limits – it can cut and merge videos with large file sizes without any trouble, and speed of it to do so is quite fast. It supports several file formats, such as AVI, MPEG, WMV, 3GP FLV, MP4, WMV, MOV, VOB, etc.</p>
<p>So, once downloaded, you will see how user-friendly and straightforward the software is: it shows two of its features right away – video cutter and video joiner. You choose which one you are about to use – so, in our case, video joiner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-3.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, you should click the the “+” icon, which lets you add files from your PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, hit on the Join button, and choose Indirect Join. Hitting on Start Join will start merging all the uploaded videos, and, wait a little until the process has been completed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-5.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clideo</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clideo.com/" >Clideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the online platform that declares that it makes it super easy to edit all your video files, images and GIFs, and is totally free. It gives us the opportunities to: merge, compress, resize, cut, make, crop, speed, rotate, add music to, loop, flip, reverse, mute, filter, and adjust the videos. Add subtitles, make memes, create slideshows, etc. Therefore, it’s pretty rich in its tools and features.</p>
<p>As for merging videos, much like Fastreel, Clideo is pretty straightforward. You just click on the mentioned tool, and then easily choose files you would like to combine – you can merge any amount of video clips there. Several files can be chosen at the same time, or they can be added one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-6.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will take you to the editor, where you can join the videos. It’s possible to rearrange the files, by using drag-and-drop until they’re in the desired order. You can also add images and set duration from them, add audio, change its length and volume. The last step is choosing the aspect ratio and clicking the Export button. You can watch the preview of your result and then click on Download if you are satisfied with the merged file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-7.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typito</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://typito.com/" >Typito <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a platform to merge videos online, as well as Fastreel and Clideo. It is free, and mostly aims to create combinations one can use to post on social network such as Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. Typito supports a great many formats, some of them being MP4, AVI, FLV and WMV. You can edit your videos before merging them by trimming, cropping and resizing, and also add transition effects and music. It quickly combines footage, doesn’t watermark the videos, has brand kit of colors, fonts and style. It can also create collection of images, which is used for making Youtube compilation at most times.</p>
<p>To merge videos, you should choose the tool, then Get Started, and register and sign in first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then click on New Project, choose a video format (the platform offers you the list of the most popular ones), and it will take you to the editor, where you start off by adding media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Drag and drop images or videos that you want to combine into a single video. You can also click to upload media files from your system or browse our Stock Media library for high-quality stock photos and video. Then, you can put your video clips in order, and work on it, if you want to use different tools, such as: edit, crop, trim, or resize them, as well as add text captions, images, and transitions. After you have previewed your video, you can click on the export button in the top right corner, and then, your merged video will be ready to be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online UniConverter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-10.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-11.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we introduced some online platforms and software for you to use if you would like to merge videos and combine them into one. These are: Fastreel, Free Video Cutter Joiner, Clideo, Typito, Online UniConverter, Wondershare Filmora. It’s up to you which one you would like to choose to merge your videos or edit them in any other way, but you can try either of them and choose to your own liking – even so, of course, there are some other video mergers worth considering, that we might mention in the coming articles. Before then, enjoy with free video editors, without watermark!</p>
