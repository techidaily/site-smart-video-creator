<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help.

<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>

Irrespective of the kind of device you’re using to edit your videos, you need to pay attention to some features your device must have. However, these requirements depend on the 4K video editing software free.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The Processor of the software being used must be Intel Core i7, 2.3Ghz four-core; this is applicable if you will be editing your videos offline. Then, Dual Intel Xeon 2Ghz six-core is applicable if you will be editing your videos online.</li>
<li><strong>Random Access Memory (RAM):</strong> Preferably an 8GB Memory if you’re editing offline, and 32GB Memory if you’re editing online.</li>
<li><strong>Internal storage:</strong> The required storage must be sufficient because 4K videos are huge files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Offline editing refers to editing a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >proxy file of the original source material <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>; online editing is the editing of the original material.</p>

<li><strong>Choose the software based on your hardware:</strong> To choose the best 4K video editing software free, you must not opt for an editing software with higher requirements than your hardware; such software won’t work well on your device. You should instead select an editing software with lower requirements.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Split large 4K videos into several parts</strong></a>: It has been reiterated that 4K videos are huge files; to edit your videos smoothly, it is recommended to split up the videos and edit one after the other. This will save you from heavy data loss.</li>
<li><strong>Enable graphics accelerator</strong>: A graphic accelerator is used in video editing to turbocharge your video exporting. It’s usually clung to a video board of your system. It makes the editing easier and faster by preventing a heavy workload.</li>

<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the most popular free 4K Video editing software. Using iMovie, you can create a professional-looking video even without any editing experience. You can import 4K images and 4K videos to iMovie, and then trim, split and add titles, transitions, filters or effects to the video by dragging and dropping. What’s more, you can import and export 60 frames per second video in iMovie.</p>
<p>iMovie is a video editing software that imports video footage from digital video cameras that use the MiniDV format. It can play DV, HDV, AVCHD, iFrame, Animation Codec, and other video formats. You can import 4K videos directly to iMovie and export them as 4K videos at 24fps&#x2F;30fps&#x2F;60fps. You can also share the 4K video to YouTube from iMovie directly.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Switching across different devices:</strong></p>
<p>This free 4K video editor is designed to work together using different devices (iPhone, iPad &amp; Mac). You can begin a project on your iPhone, then transfer it to your iPad using AirDrop or iCloud Drive. It allows you to share what you have worked on to different devices, and you can also send projects from your iPad to your MacBook or iMac.</p>
<p><strong>2. Advanced editing features:</strong></p>
<p>What makes this free 4K video editor special is the ability to add some innovative editing functions when creating and editing your videos. Understandably, any video editor should offer basic editing features; however, iMovie allows you to work with more advanced functions like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >split-screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >picture-in-picture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >green-screen effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Saving all the original files</strong></p>
<p>An advantage of working with different devices provides an opportunity to save all original files. It saves you time since you can import any media you need to get your project started in the video editor without losing the original files.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Distorted files: If you don’t follow the importing and exporting process, the files might get distorted, resulting in fuzzy images.</li>
<li>Only available on iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPad devices</li>

You can now search the resources in the search bar and drag and drop them to the timeline to preview the result without paying first.</p>
<p>Some of you may say, Filmora is not a free video editor since there will be a watermark at the export video. But here, I will introduce the Instant Cutter Tool which is a perfect tool to trim and merge large 4K videos and action camera videos. This free 4k tool provides a proper way of instantly trimming or merging videos without de-coding, which means the video resolution will not be changed. Using the instant cutter tool, you can upload or merge files of huge sizes in different formats, such as  MP4&#x2F;MOV or  MTS&#x2F;M2TS.</p>

Irrespective of the kind of device you’re using to edit your videos, you need to pay attention to some features your device must have. However, these requirements depend on the 4K video editing software free.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The Processor of the software being used must be Intel Core i7, 2.3Ghz four-core; this is applicable if you will be editing your videos offline. Then, Dual Intel Xeon 2Ghz six-core is applicable if you will be editing your videos online.</li>
<li><strong>Random Access Memory (RAM):</strong> Preferably an 8GB Memory if you’re editing offline, and 32GB Memory if you’re editing online.</li>
<li><strong>Internal storage:</strong> The required storage must be sufficient because 4K videos are huge files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Offline editing refers to editing a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >proxy file of the original source material <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>; online editing is the editing of the original material.</p>

<li><strong>Choose the software based on your hardware:</strong> To choose the best 4K video editing software free, you must not opt for an editing software with higher requirements than your hardware; such software won’t work well on your device. You should instead select an editing software with lower requirements.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Split large 4K videos into several parts</strong></a>: It has been reiterated that 4K videos are huge files; to edit your videos smoothly, it is recommended to split up the videos and edit one after the other. This will save you from heavy data loss.</li>
<li><strong>Enable graphics accelerator</strong>: A graphic accelerator is used in video editing to turbocharge your video exporting. It’s usually clung to a video board of your system. It makes the editing easier and faster by preventing a heavy workload.</li>

<p>Although Premiere is a complete and robust platform, there is always room for customization, extras, and just plain cool add-ons that are too niche for Adobe to produce themselves.</p>
<p>For example, you can add <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free Adobe Premiere title templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to make your video excellent.</p>

There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.</p>
<p>Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.</p>
<p>Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.</p>

It is very good at it.</p>
<p>While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.</p>
<p>It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.</p>
<p>Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.</p>

One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.</p>
<p>What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.</p>
<p>It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $79&#x2F;$99.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fluent workflow</strong>: the working experience is great if you try it.</li>
<li>Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.</li>

There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.</p>
<p>Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.</p>
<p>Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.</p>
<p>It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $20.99&#x2F;month</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steep learning</strong>: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.</li>
<li><strong>Animation</strong>: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.</li>

It is very good at it.</p>
<p>While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.</p>
<p>It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.</p>
<p>Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $74.9&#x2F;month</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>

If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $2495 for all bundles</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stylized looks</strong>: it offers various filters to use</li>

The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.</p>
<p>In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $899</p>

One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.</p>
<p>What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.</p>
<p>It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $79&#x2F;$99.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fluent workflow</strong>: the working experience is great if you try it.</li>
<li>Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.</li>

There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.</p>

<p>Although Premiere is a complete and robust platform, there is always room for customization, extras, and just plain cool add-ons that are too niche for Adobe to produce themselves.</p>
<p>For example, you can add <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free Adobe Premiere title templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to make your video excellent.</p>
<p>While everyone’s list will be different depending on what they use Premiere for, here is my choice of tools and effects that I find the most useful.</p>

There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.</p>
<p>Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.</p>
<p>Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.</p>
<p>It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $20.99&#x2F;month</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steep learning</strong>: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.</li>
<li><strong>Animation</strong>: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.</li>

It is very good at it.</p>
<p>While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.</p>
<p>It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.</p>
<p>Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $74.9&#x2F;month</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Underwater shots</strong>: You can make underwater shots with this plug-in. With it, you can make your video more beautiful.</li>
<li><strong>Accurate and efficient</strong>: As the best Adobe Premiere plugin, it can offer you an accurate effect.</li>

If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $2495 for all bundles</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stylized looks</strong>: it offers various filters to use</li>
<li><strong>Auto-animating transitions</strong>: you can make animation style transitions auto.</li>

The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.</p>
<p>In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $899</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Great compatibility</strong>: it works well on Windows and Mac.</li>

One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.</p>
<p>What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.</p>
<p>It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $79&#x2F;$99.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fluent workflow</strong>: the working experience is great if you try it.</li>
<li>Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.</li>

There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.</p>

That is light rays to be precise. Atmospheric, beautiful, they can be many things, but there is no questioning the effectiveness of this plugin at simulating light rays. It’s outstanding, as this promotional image shows.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $95</p>

<p>Although Premiere is a complete and robust platform, there is always room for customization, extras, and just plain cool add-ons that are too niche for Adobe to produce themselves.</p>
<p>For example, you can add <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free Adobe Premiere title templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to make your video excellent.</p>

There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.</p>
<p>Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.</p>
<p>Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.</p>
<p>It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $20.99&#x2F;month</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steep learning</strong>: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.</li>
<li><strong>Animation</strong>: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.</li>

It is very good at it.</p>
<p>While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.</p>
<p>It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.</p>
<p>Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $74.9&#x2F;month</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>

The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.</p>
<p>In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.</p>

One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.</p>
<p>What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.</p>
<p>It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $79&#x2F;$99.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fluent workflow</strong>: the working experience is great if you try it.</li>
<li>Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.</li>

There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.</p>
