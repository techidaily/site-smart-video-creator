How to Use Stop Motion Studio?</h2><p>With the help of Stop Motion Studio, you can make animation by combining multiple pictures. You need to download Stop Motion Studio Pro for your iOS or Android device to use the app. You can also download it for PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="download stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-movie-in-stop-motion-studio.jpg"
                      alt="adding new movie in stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="changing frame rate on stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>

<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>

                      alt="changing frame rate on stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>

<p>Step 5: You are done!! Yes, it was that simple and easy to create a great stop motion video yourself.</p>
<p>If you want to make a basic video and add audio, the Stop Motion Studio free version is ideal for you. But if you’re going to explore more app features, you need to buy Stop Motion Studio Pro Windows, a paid version of the app.</p>

<p>The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.</p>
<p>But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.</p>

<h3 id="1-EZGIF-com"><a href="#1-EZGIF-com" class="headerlink" title="1. EZGIF.com"></a>1. EZGIF.com</h3><p>This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site</li>
<li>Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-ezgif.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in EZgif"
                ></p>
<p>To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ezgif.com/speed" >https://ezgif.com/speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="2-Veed-io"><a href="#2-Veed-io" class="headerlink" title="2. Veed.io"></a>2. Veed.io</h3><p>This site, found at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer" >https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic"><a href="#3-Lunapic" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img

                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-GifGit"><a href="#4-GifGit" class="headerlink" title="4. GifGit"></a>4. GifGit</h3><p><img

                      alt="change gif speed in GifGit"
                ></p>
<p>Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit" >https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.</p>
<p>This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!</p>
<h3 id="5-IMG-Flip"><a href="#5-IMG-Flip" class="headerlink" title="5. IMG Flip"></a>5. IMG Flip</h3><p>As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.</p>
<p><img

To change the speed you simply need upload your clip and then adjust the speed as a percentage of the original clip – 100% being the starting point, with 200% running the GIF at twice the speed and 50% running it at half speed.</p>

We particularly love the fact that ImgPlay’s platform allows users to add their own text and emojis over the top of the visuals, completely personalising the end product and creating something which is unique for their own use. A simple slider tool allows for easy editing of the GIF speed, presenting an all-round great tool for beginners and experience GIF makers alike.</p>

<p>The Imgur app is one of the most popular GIF creation tools out there – offering users with a platform which allows them edit as many GIFs as they like, play with the speed of existing and new GIFs, and share their creations with other users who can share your designs and help you go viral. As much an online community as a GIF editing tool, Imgur could well be the new Instagram – if Instagram suddenly decided to wave goodbye to the influencers and adverts and make way for user built content and humorous motion videos instead!</p>

<p>One of the fastest tools both to understand and to use, GIF studio really lets you feel like you are in a proper video editing studio – even when using the limited screen size of your phone. Users can edit the speed on existing GIFs or can create new collages with multiple GIFs, benefitting from added animation and colour and visual effects without losing the quality of the original imagery or footage.</p>
<h4 id="GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ"><a href="#GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ" class="headerlink" title="GIF Speed Changer FAQ"></a>GIF Speed Changer FAQ</h4><p><strong>Can I slow down a GIF?</strong></p>
<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>

<p>The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.</p>

<h3 id="1-EZGIF-com-1"><a href="#1-EZGIF-com-1" class="headerlink" title="1. EZGIF.com"></a>1. EZGIF.com</h3><p>This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site</li>
<li>Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-ezgif.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in EZgif"
                ></p>
<p>To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ezgif.com/speed" >https://ezgif.com/speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="2-Veed-io-1"><a href="#2-Veed-io-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Veed.io"></a>2. Veed.io</h3><p>This site, found at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer" >https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic-1"><a href="#3-Lunapic-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-GifGit-1"><a href="#4-GifGit-1" class="headerlink" title="4. GifGit"></a>4. GifGit</h3><p><img

                      alt="change gif speed in GifGit"
                ></p>
<p>Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit" >https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.</p>
<p>This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!</p>
<h3 id="5-IMG-Flip-1"><a href="#5-IMG-Flip-1" class="headerlink" title="5. IMG Flip"></a>5. IMG Flip</h3><p>As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

To change the speed you simply need upload your clip and then adjust the speed as a percentage of the original clip – 100% being the starting point, with 200% running the GIF at twice the speed and 50% running it at half speed.</p>

<p>We start with a simple one which can be found on the app store using any search for a GIF app. This particular app plays on the concept of building your own memes, giving users a chance to enhance their own comic value on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook using their own images or multiple GIF’s strung together. We particularly love the fact that ImgPlay’s platform allows users to add their own text and emojis over the top of the visuals, completely personalising the end product and creating something which is unique for their own use. A simple slider tool allows for easy editing of the GIF speed, presenting an all-round great tool for beginners and experience GIF makers alike.</p>

<h3 id="1-EZGIF-com-2"><a href="#1-EZGIF-com-2" class="headerlink" title="1. EZGIF.com"></a>1. EZGIF.com</h3><p>This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site</li>
<li>Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-ezgif.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in EZgif"
                ></p>
<p>To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ezgif.com/speed" >https://ezgif.com/speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="2-Veed-io-2"><a href="#2-Veed-io-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Veed.io"></a>2. Veed.io</h3><p>This site, found at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer" >https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-veed.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic-2"><a href="#3-Lunapic-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-GifGit-2"><a href="#4-GifGit-2" class="headerlink" title="4. GifGit"></a>4. GifGit</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change gif speed in GifGit"
                ></p>
<p>Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit" >https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.</p>
<p>This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!</p>
<h3 id="5-IMG-Flip-2"><a href="#5-IMG-Flip-2" class="headerlink" title="5. IMG Flip"></a>5. IMG Flip</h3><p>As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

To change the speed you simply need upload your clip and then adjust the speed as a percentage of the original clip – 100% being the starting point, with 200% running the GIF at twice the speed and 50% running it at half speed.</p>

So, which are the best GIF speed changers for phones?</p>

                ></p>
<p>We start with a simple one which can be found on the app store using any search for a GIF app. This particular app plays on the concept of building your own memes, giving users a chance to enhance their own comic value on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook using their own images or multiple GIF’s strung together. We particularly love the fact that ImgPlay’s platform allows users to add their own text and emojis over the top of the visuals, completely personalising the end product and creating something which is unique for their own use. A simple slider tool allows for easy editing of the GIF speed, presenting an all-round great tool for beginners and experience GIF makers alike.</p>

<p>The Imgur app is one of the most popular GIF creation tools out there – offering users with a platform which allows them edit as many GIFs as they like, play with the speed of existing and new GIFs, and share their creations with other users who can share your designs and help you go viral. As much an online community as a GIF editing tool, Imgur could well be the new Instagram – if Instagram suddenly decided to wave goodbye to the influencers and adverts and make way for user built content and humorous motion videos instead!</p>

<p>This is a tool which supports the creation of GIFs using actions and movements which you capture on camera straight into the app. Opening the app, you simply select the camera feature and capture the movement or motion – before diving into the editing of speed, colour, appearance and overlays. A great tool which is instant to use and allows you to create funny and more serious GIFs depending on the movement you capture.</p>

<p>This platform is designed to allow users to edit and add to existing GIFs which they may want to adjust, add filters to and overlay with music. As with many of the other portable device tools created for Android and iPhone, the main features of this app are its user friendly interface and the fact that all GIFs created can be downloaded directly to the phone or uploaded straight to social media – depending on how the user intends to use their GIF.</p>

<p>One of the fastest tools both to understand and to use, GIF studio really lets you feel like you are in a proper video editing studio – even when using the limited screen size of your phone. Users can edit the speed on existing GIFs or can create new collages with multiple GIFs, benefitting from added animation and colour and visual effects without losing the quality of the original imagery or footage.</p>
<h4 id="GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-2"><a href="#GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-2" class="headerlink" title="GIF Speed Changer FAQ"></a>GIF Speed Changer FAQ</h4><p><strong>Can I slow down a GIF?</strong></p>
<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>

Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-veed.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic-3"><a href="#3-Lunapic-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-lunapic.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-GifGit-3"><a href="#4-GifGit-3" class="headerlink" title="4. GifGit"></a>4. GifGit</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-gifgit.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in GifGit"
                ></p>
<p>Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit" >https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.</p>
<p>This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!</p>
<h3 id="5-IMG-Flip-3"><a href="#5-IMG-Flip-3" class="headerlink" title="5. IMG Flip"></a>5. IMG Flip</h3><p>As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change gif speed in  IMG Flip"
                ></p>
<p>Get familiar with IMG Flip through this link - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgflip.com/gif-maker" >https://imgflip.com/gif-maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - and spend some time working through the different options available. To change the speed you simply need upload your clip and then adjust the speed as a percentage of the original clip – 100% being the starting point, with 200% running the GIF at twice the speed and 50% running it at half speed.</p>

Our phones are what we have with us at all times, and so it follows that any kind of editing we hope to do should be achievable using these portable devices – after all, modern smartphones are now fitted with cameras which surpass the capability of even some of the most expensive cameras on the market. So, which are the best GIF speed changers for phones?</p>

                ></p>
<p>We start with a simple one which can be found on the app store using any search for a GIF app. This particular app plays on the concept of building your own memes, giving users a chance to enhance their own comic value on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook using their own images or multiple GIF’s strung together. We particularly love the fact that ImgPlay’s platform allows users to add their own text and emojis over the top of the visuals, completely personalising the end product and creating something which is unique for their own use. A simple slider tool allows for easy editing of the GIF speed, presenting an all-round great tool for beginners and experience GIF makers alike.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Imgur app is one of the most popular GIF creation tools out there – offering users with a platform which allows them edit as many GIFs as they like, play with the speed of existing and new GIFs, and share their creations with other users who can share your designs and help you go viral. As much an online community as a GIF editing tool, Imgur could well be the new Instagram – if Instagram suddenly decided to wave goodbye to the influencers and adverts and make way for user built content and humorous motion videos instead!</p>

                ></p>
<p>This is a tool which supports the creation of GIFs using actions and movements which you capture on camera straight into the app. Opening the app, you simply select the camera feature and capture the movement or motion – before diving into the editing of speed, colour, appearance and overlays. A great tool which is instant to use and allows you to create funny and more serious GIFs depending on the movement you capture.</p>

<p>This platform is designed to allow users to edit and add to existing GIFs which they may want to adjust, add filters to and overlay with music. As with many of the other portable device tools created for Android and iPhone, the main features of this app are its user friendly interface and the fact that all GIFs created can be downloaded directly to the phone or uploaded straight to social media – depending on how the user intends to use their GIF.</p>
<h3 id="5-GIF-Studio-3"><a href="#5-GIF-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="5. GIF Studio"></a>5. GIF Studio</h3><p>Finally, an Android tool.</p>

                ></p>
<p>One of the fastest tools both to understand and to use, GIF studio really lets you feel like you are in a proper video editing studio – even when using the limited screen size of your phone. Users can edit the speed on existing GIFs or can create new collages with multiple GIFs, benefitting from added animation and colour and visual effects without losing the quality of the original imagery or footage.</p>
<h4 id="GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-3"><a href="#GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-3" class="headerlink" title="GIF Speed Changer FAQ"></a>GIF Speed Changer FAQ</h4><p><strong>Can I slow down a GIF?</strong></p>
<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>
