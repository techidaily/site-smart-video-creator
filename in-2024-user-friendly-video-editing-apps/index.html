If you don’t want to install any software on your computer, you can try these online video editors or the preset video makers; if you want to improve the video quality, desktop software is recommended.</p>

Mac and PC users have a broad range of options at their disposal if they want to make still images from their videos. Let’s have a look at some of the best video converters you can use to capture still frames and create JPEG or PNG files.</p>

<p>To extract still images with the original high quality, you can import and place these videos to Project Media and then double-click it to preview. In the preview window, click the Camera icon located in the lower right corner to take a snapshot. It is worth noting that you can only create PNG files with this video editing software, and you may need to change the photo format if PNG isn’t your choice.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the CTRL+ALT+S keyboard shortcut to take a snapshot of the frame in a video clip. The image you created will be added to the Media tab automatically, and you can proceed to right-click on it and select the Reveal in Explorer option to gain access to the original file.</p>
<p>To extract still image from the video frame by frame, you can add the media asset to the timeline and use the playhead to find the frame you would like to extract from the video. When done, leave the playhead at the location on the timeline where the frame is located, and then click on the Snapshot icon.</p>

Adobe Photoshop also enables its users to edit videos, although in a limited capacity. In order to turn a video into a series of separate frames, you just have to import a video file into Adobe Photoshop by clicking on the file menu and selecting the Import option.</p>

<p>The video clip is going to be displayed on the timeline that is located at the bottom of the screen and you just have to specify the segment of that file you would like to break down into frames. You can do this by dragging the handles located above the video clip that allows you to set the start and end of the work area.</p>

After the Render Video window pops up on the screen, you have to change the Adobe Media Encoder option to Photoshop Image Sequence and then click on the Render button. You should keep in mind that the photo editor is going to create separate image files for all the frames that were within the work area you defined, which is why it is important to reduce the work area to the minimum in order to avoid generating hundreds of JPEG images.</p>

<p>Click on the Save button to confirm the changes, then go back to the Filter submenu, and this time you should click on it rather than expand it. Locate the Scene Video filter, make sure that the checkbox next to it is selected, and click OK to complete the process.</p>

You have to select the Image Converter tool and then choose the output format of the images you want to extract from the video. You can then upload a video file from Dropbox, Google Drive, or your computer’s hard drive.</p>
<p><img

The maximum size of the video file you can upload to AConvert is limited to just 200MB.</p>

Mac and PC users have a broad range of options at their disposal if they want to make still images from their videos. Let’s have a look at some of the best video converters you can use to capture still frames and create JPEG or PNG files.</p>
<h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>To extract still images with the original high quality, you can import and place these videos to Project Media and then double-click it to preview. In the preview window, click the Camera icon located in the lower right corner to take a snapshot. It is worth noting that you can only create PNG files with this video editing software, and you may need to change the photo format if PNG isn’t your choice.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the CTRL+ALT+S keyboard shortcut to take a snapshot of the frame in a video clip. The image you created will be added to the Media tab automatically, and you can proceed to right-click on it and select the Reveal in Explorer option to gain access to the original file.</p>
<p>To extract still image from the video frame by frame, you can add the media asset to the timeline and use the playhead to find the frame you would like to extract from the video. When done, leave the playhead at the location on the timeline where the frame is located, and then click on the Snapshot icon.</p>

Adobe Photoshop also enables its users to edit videos, although in a limited capacity. In order to turn a video into a series of separate frames, you just have to import a video file into Adobe Photoshop by clicking on the file menu and selecting the Import option.</p>

<p>The video clip is going to be displayed on the timeline that is located at the bottom of the screen and you just have to specify the segment of that file you would like to break down into frames. You can do this by dragging the handles located above the video clip that allows you to set the start and end of the work area.</p>

<p>When done, head over to the File menu, and select the Render Video option from the Export submenu. After the Render Video window pops up on the screen, you have to change the Adobe Media Encoder option to Photoshop Image Sequence and then click on the Render button. You should keep in mind that the photo editor is going to create separate image files for all the frames that were within the work area you defined, which is why it is important to reduce the work area to the minimum in order to avoid generating hundreds of JPEG images.</p>

<p>Select the Preferences option from the Tools menu and then click on the Video tab.

Locate the Scene Filter, click on it and then proceed to specify the format in which your images are going to be saved and adjust the Recording Ratio.</p>
<p>Click on the Save button to confirm the changes, then go back to the Filter submenu, and this time you should click on it rather than expand it. Locate the Scene Video filter, make sure that the checkbox next to it is selected, and click OK to complete the process.</p>

Installing this plugin can get a little technical, but it is far from being complicated. Afterward, you just have to launch Virtual Dub and import the video you would like to use to create JPEG files by clicking on the File menu and selecting the Open option.</p>

Mac and PC users have a broad range of options at their disposal if they want to make still images from their videos. Let’s have a look at some of the best video converters you can use to capture still frames and create JPEG or PNG files.</p>
<h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>To extract still images with the original high quality, you can import and place these videos to Project Media and then double-click it to preview. In the preview window, click the Camera icon located in the lower right corner to take a snapshot. It is worth noting that you can only create PNG files with this video editing software, and you may need to change the photo format if PNG isn’t your choice.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the CTRL+ALT+S keyboard shortcut to take a snapshot of the frame in a video clip. The image you created will be added to the Media tab automatically, and you can proceed to right-click on it and select the Reveal in Explorer option to gain access to the original file.</p>
<p>To extract still image from the video frame by frame, you can add the media asset to the timeline and use the playhead to find the frame you would like to extract from the video. When done, leave the playhead at the location on the timeline where the frame is located, and then click on the Snapshot icon.</p>

Adobe Photoshop also enables its users to edit videos, although in a limited capacity. In order to turn a video into a series of separate frames, you just have to import a video file into Adobe Photoshop by clicking on the file menu and selecting the Import option.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>The video clip is going to be displayed on the timeline that is located at the bottom of the screen and you just have to specify the segment of that file you would like to break down into frames. You can do this by dragging the handles located above the video clip that allows you to set the start and end of the work area.</p>

                ></p>
<p>When done, head over to the File menu, and select the Render Video option from the Export submenu. After the Render Video window pops up on the screen, you have to change the Adobe Media Encoder option to Photoshop Image Sequence and then click on the Render button. You should keep in mind that the photo editor is going to create separate image files for all the frames that were within the work area you defined, which is why it is important to reduce the work area to the minimum in order to avoid generating hundreds of JPEG images.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Select the Preferences option from the Tools menu and then click on the Video tab. Make sure that the All option is selected under Show Settings and scroll down until you find the Filters option and expand this menu. Locate the Scene Filter, click on it and then proceed to specify the format in which your images are going to be saved and adjust the Recording Ratio.</p>
<p>Click on the Save button to confirm the changes, then go back to the Filter submenu, and this time you should click on it rather than expand it. Locate the Scene Video filter, make sure that the checkbox next to it is selected, and click OK to complete the process.</p>

After you open Free Video to JPEG Converter you just have to click on the Add Files button and import a video from which you would like to extract still frames.</p>
<p><img

Installing this plugin can get a little technical, but it is far from being complicated. Afterward, you just have to launch Virtual Dub and import the video you would like to use to create JPEG files by clicking on the File menu and selecting the Open option.</p>

Here are some of the best web-based platforms you can use to convert videos to JPEG or PNG images.</p>
<h3 id="1-Online-Convert-2"><a href="#1-Online-Convert-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

You have to select the Image Converter tool and then choose the output format of the images you want to extract from the video. You can then upload a video file from Dropbox, Google Drive, or your computer’s hard drive.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Before the conversion, you can adjust the Quality Settings and choose if the compression is going to be high, medium, or low, but you must be logged in to save these changes. Click on the Start Conversion button when ready, and wait for the platform to process your video. Each frame of the video you uploaded is going to be converted into a photo and you can choose how many images you want to download or delete.</p>

After you arrive at AConvert’s home page, you just have to click on the Image option and then choose if you want to import a file from your computer or cloud storage. The maximum size of the video file you can upload to AConvert is limited to just 200MB.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" Convert Video to Image Online-Convert  "
                ></p>
<p>Once the video file you selected is uploaded to the platform you can choose the output file format and decide if you want to resize the images during the conversion or keep their original size. Click on the Convert Now button and then download the image files once the still frames are extracted from the video.</p>
<h3 id="3-Online-Converter-2"><a href="#3-Online-Converter-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

Its Video to JPEG tool supports nearly all common video file formats, which enables you to extract still frames from videos without having to worry about their compatibility with this tool. You can either upload a video via URL or from a local hard drive, but its size cannot be larger than 200 MB.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="   Online-Convert video to JPG "
                ></p>
<p>The platform lets you choose if you want to cut a video clip, change its frame size or adjust its quality. Once you fine-tune all the settings click on the Convert button to start creating JPEG files from a video and then download the images to your computer.</p>
<h3 id="4-IMG2GO-2"><a href="#4-IMG2GO-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

                ></p>
<p>The number of JPEG files IMG2GO will generate depends on the duration of the clip, which is the reason why it is better to extract still frames from shorter videos. Once the conversion process is completed you can choose if you want to save the images on the cloud or to a local hard drive.</p>
<h3 id="5-Kapwing-2"><a href="#5-Kapwing-2" class="headerlink" title="5.

Wondershare Filmora"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Filmora is a video editing software that also offers the option to capture frames of all video clips you use in your projects after you launch the Filmora video editor, import a video file that contains the frames you would like to save as still images.</p>
<p>To extract still images with the original high quality, you can import and place these videos to Project Media and then double-click it to preview. In the preview window, click the Camera icon located in the lower right corner to take a snapshot. It is worth noting that you can only create PNG files with this video editing software, and you may need to change the photo format if PNG isn’t your choice.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the CTRL+ALT+S keyboard shortcut to take a snapshot of the frame in a video clip. The image you created will be added to the Media tab automatically, and you can proceed to right-click on it and select the Reveal in Explorer option to gain access to the original file.</p>
<p>To extract still image from the video frame by frame, you can add the media asset to the timeline and use the playhead to find the frame you would like to extract from the video. When done, leave the playhead at the location on the timeline where the frame is located, and then click on the Snapshot icon.</p>

Adobe Photoshop also enables its users to edit videos, although in a limited capacity. In order to turn a video into a series of separate frames, you just have to import a video file into Adobe Photoshop by clicking on the file menu and selecting the Import option.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>The video clip is going to be displayed on the timeline that is located at the bottom of the screen and you just have to specify the segment of that file you would like to break down into frames. You can do this by dragging the handles located above the video clip that allows you to set the start and end of the work area.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>When done, head over to the File menu, and select the Render Video option from the Export submenu. After the Render Video window pops up on the screen, you have to change the Adobe Media Encoder option to Photoshop Image Sequence and then click on the Render button. You should keep in mind that the photo editor is going to create separate image files for all the frames that were within the work area you defined, which is why it is important to reduce the work area to the minimum in order to avoid generating hundreds of JPEG images.</p>

<p>Select the Preferences option from the Tools menu and then click on the Video tab. Make sure that the All option is selected under Show Settings and scroll down until you find the Filters option and expand this menu. Locate the Scene Filter, click on it and then proceed to specify the format in which your images are going to be saved and adjust the Recording Ratio.</p>
<p>Click on the Save button to confirm the changes, then go back to the Filter submenu, and this time you should click on it rather than expand it. Locate the Scene Video filter, make sure that the checkbox next to it is selected, and click OK to complete the process.</p>

After you open Free Video to JPEG Converter you just have to click on the Add Files button and import a video from which you would like to extract still frames.</p>
<p><img

Installing this plugin can get a little technical, but it is far from being complicated. Afterward, you just have to launch Virtual Dub and import the video you would like to use to create JPEG files by clicking on the File menu and selecting the Open option.</p>

Here are some of the best web-based platforms you can use to convert videos to JPEG or PNG images.</p>
<h3 id="1-Online-Convert-3"><a href="#1-Online-Convert-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

You have to select the Image Converter tool and then choose the output format of the images you want to extract from the video. You can then upload a video file from Dropbox, Google Drive, or your computer’s hard drive.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Before the conversion, you can adjust the Quality Settings and choose if the compression is going to be high, medium, or low, but you must be logged in to save these changes. Click on the Start Conversion button when ready, and wait for the platform to process your video. Each frame of the video you uploaded is going to be converted into a photo and you can choose how many images you want to download or delete.</p>

                      alt=" Convert Video to Image Online-Convert  "
                ></p>
<p>Once the video file you selected is uploaded to the platform you can choose the output file format and decide if you want to resize the images during the conversion or keep their original size. Click on the Convert Now button and then download the image files once the still frames are extracted from the video.</p>
<h3 id="3-Online-Converter-3"><a href="#3-Online-Converter-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Its Video to JPEG tool supports nearly all common video file formats, which enables you to extract still frames from videos without having to worry about their compatibility with this tool. You can either upload a video via URL or from a local hard drive, but its size cannot be larger than 200 MB.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>The platform lets you choose if you want to cut a video clip, change its frame size or adjust its quality. Once you fine-tune all the settings click on the Convert button to start creating JPEG files from a video and then download the images to your computer.</p>
<h3 id="4-IMG2GO-3"><a href="#4-IMG2GO-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

                ></p>
<p>The number of JPEG files IMG2GO will generate depends on the duration of the clip, which is the reason why it is better to extract still frames from shorter videos. Once the conversion process is completed you can choose if you want to save the images on the cloud or to a local hard drive.</p>
<h3 id="5-Kapwing-3"><a href="#5-Kapwing-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

But of course, the resources are endless and in case we have some information, we can easily access the free video editing platforms which give us the opportunity to edit our videos without undesired logos on them. In this case, we will be discussing 6 video mergers without watermark, and the way we can use them – the tools and features they offer, and how we can get the best out of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photos by Microsoft</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?"></a>How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/merging-videos-photos-app.png"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Photos App</strong></p>
<p>Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a New Project</strong></p>
<p>Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Clips</strong></p>
<p>Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fastreel by Movavi</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastreel.com/" >Fastreel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop&#x2F;add multiple files right away.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free Video Cutter Joiner</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.freevideocutterjoiner.com/" >Free Video Cutter Joiner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – the name already explains it all by itself! This is a free video merger which will not add watermark on your video. The software needs to be downloaded, and contributes to quickly cutting and joining videos. Free Video Cutter Joiner has no size limits – it can cut and merge videos with large file sizes without any trouble, and speed of it to do so is quite fast. It supports several file formats, such as AVI, MPEG, WMV, 3GP FLV, MP4, WMV, MOV, VOB, etc.</p>
<p>So, once downloaded, you will see how user-friendly and straightforward the software is: it shows two of its features right away – video cutter and video joiner. You choose which one you are about to use – so, in our case, video joiner.</p>

<li><strong>Clideo</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clideo.com/" >Clideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the online platform that declares that it makes it super easy to edit all your video files, images and GIFs, and is totally free. It gives us the opportunities to: merge, compress, resize, cut, make, crop, speed, rotate, add music to, loop, flip, reverse, mute, filter, and adjust the videos. Add subtitles, make memes, create slideshows, etc. Therefore, it’s pretty rich in its tools and features.</p>
<p>As for merging videos, much like Fastreel, Clideo is pretty straightforward. You just click on the mentioned tool, and then easily choose files you would like to combine – you can merge any amount of video clips there. Several files can be chosen at the same time, or they can be added one by one.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Then click on New Project, choose a video format (the platform offers you the list of the most popular ones), and it will take you to the editor, where you start off by adding media.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Online UniConverter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we introduced some online platforms and software for you to use if you would like to merge videos and combine them into one. These are: Fastreel, Free Video Cutter Joiner, Clideo, Typito, Online UniConverter, Wondershare Filmora. It’s up to you which one you would like to choose to merge your videos or edit them in any other way, but you can try either of them and choose to your own liking – even so, of course, there are some other video mergers worth considering, that we might mention in the coming articles. Before then, enjoy with free video editors, without watermark!</p>
<p>If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-1"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?"></a>How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Photos App</strong></p>
<p>Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a New Project</strong></p>
<p>Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Clips</strong></p>
<p>Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fastreel by Movavi</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastreel.com/" >Fastreel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop&#x2F;add multiple files right away.</p>

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.</p>

You can also add images and set duration from them, add audio, change its length and volume. The last step is choosing the aspect ratio and clicking the Export button. You can watch the preview of your result and then click on Download if you are satisfied with the merged file.</p>

<li><strong>Online UniConverter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we introduced some online platforms and software for you to use if you would like to merge videos and combine them into one. These are: Fastreel, Free Video Cutter Joiner, Clideo, Typito, Online UniConverter, Wondershare Filmora. It’s up to you which one you would like to choose to merge your videos or edit them in any other way, but you can try either of them and choose to your own liking – even so, of course, there are some other video mergers worth considering, that we might mention in the coming articles. Before then, enjoy with free video editors, without watermark!</p>
<p>If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-2"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?"></a>How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Photos App</strong></p>
<p>Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a New Project</strong></p>
<p>Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Clips</strong></p>
<p>Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fastreel by Movavi</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastreel.com/" >Fastreel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop&#x2F;add multiple files right away.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.</p>
<p><img

After you have previewed your video, you can click on the export button in the top right corner, and then, your merged video will be ready to be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online UniConverter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.</p>

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we introduced some online platforms and software for you to use if you would like to merge videos and combine them into one. These are: Fastreel, Free Video Cutter Joiner, Clideo, Typito, Online UniConverter, Wondershare Filmora. It’s up to you which one you would like to choose to merge your videos or edit them in any other way, but you can try either of them and choose to your own liking – even so, of course, there are some other video mergers worth considering, that we might mention in the coming articles. Before then, enjoy with free video editors, without watermark!</p>
<p>If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-3"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?"></a>How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/merging-videos-photos-app.png"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Photos App</strong></p>
<p>Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a New Project</strong></p>
<p>Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Clips</strong></p>
<p>Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fastreel by Movavi</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastreel.com/" >Fastreel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop&#x2F;add multiple files right away.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-1.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-2.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free Video Cutter Joiner</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.freevideocutterjoiner.com/" >Free Video Cutter Joiner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – the name already explains it all by itself! This is a free video merger which will not add watermark on your video. The software needs to be downloaded, and contributes to quickly cutting and joining videos. Free Video Cutter Joiner has no size limits – it can cut and merge videos with large file sizes without any trouble, and speed of it to do so is quite fast. It supports several file formats, such as AVI, MPEG, WMV, 3GP FLV, MP4, WMV, MOV, VOB, etc.</p>
<p>So, once downloaded, you will see how user-friendly and straightforward the software is: it shows two of its features right away – video cutter and video joiner. You choose which one you are about to use – so, in our case, video joiner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-3.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, you should click the the “+” icon, which lets you add files from your PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, hit on the Join button, and choose Indirect Join. Hitting on Start Join will start merging all the uploaded videos, and, wait a little until the process has been completed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clideo</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clideo.com/" >Clideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the online platform that declares that it makes it super easy to edit all your video files, images and GIFs, and is totally free. It gives us the opportunities to: merge, compress, resize, cut, make, crop, speed, rotate, add music to, loop, flip, reverse, mute, filter, and adjust the videos. Add subtitles, make memes, create slideshows, etc. Therefore, it’s pretty rich in its tools and features.</p>
<p>As for merging videos, much like Fastreel, Clideo is pretty straightforward. You just click on the mentioned tool, and then easily choose files you would like to combine – you can merge any amount of video clips there. Several files can be chosen at the same time, or they can be added one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will take you to the editor, where you can join the videos. It’s possible to rearrange the files, by using drag-and-drop until they’re in the desired order. You can also add images and set duration from them, add audio, change its length and volume. The last step is choosing the aspect ratio and clicking the Export button. You can watch the preview of your result and then click on Download if you are satisfied with the merged file.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Then click on New Project, choose a video format (the platform offers you the list of the most popular ones), and it will take you to the editor, where you start off by adding media.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Drag and drop images or videos that you want to combine into a single video. You can also click to upload media files from your system or browse our Stock Media library for high-quality stock photos and video.

<li>Exported files will have the Rocketium watermark</li>
<li>Some users have complained about the mobile version not being as robust as the desktop one</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-Movie-Maker-Online-3"><a href="#7-Movie-Maker-Online-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Movie Maker Online"></a>7. Movie Maker Online</h3><p>Another fantastic and free reverse video online creator which requires no registration whatsoever. Furthermore, you won’t have to worry about any site labels or watermarks on edited videos.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://moviemakeronline.com/a/reverse-video" >Visit the online video reverser’s page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and drag-and-drop your video to start editing. It’s fairly straightforward and quick. Save and download your video, and you can reverse it to your heart’s content!</p>
<p>Movie Maker Online is a fantastic introductory platform if you’ve no experiencing editing or reversing videos. Additional features include the ability to trim, merge and rotate videos. You can speed up and splice reversed videos and do joining and cutting according to the final result you desire. You can also add free music to your edited videos and a music fade in&#x2F;fade out effect.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fantastic results without any watermarks</li>
<li>Music fade in&#x2F;fade out features not found in other online video reversers</li>
<li>Preview feature helps you fine-tune output as desired</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ads pop up expectedly throughout the editing process making it difficult to focus</li>
<li>Uploading speed can be slow at times which becomes annoying when you just want to edit the video and quickly share it</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-Resizegram-3"><a href="#8-Resizegram-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Resizegram"></a>8. Resizegram</h3><p>No list talking about online video reverser tools would be complete without mention of Resizegram. Everything beautifully as you’d expect straight out of your browser like the other online video reversers.</p>
<p>Choose your <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.resizegram.com/reverse-video/" >file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by browsing from your device or drag-and-drop directly. Resizegram supports videos as large as half a gigabyte, so if you’re planning to upload large files, it could take up to 10 minutes or more, depending on your internet connection.</p>
<p>While your file is getting uploaded, you need to keep your browser window open, although you can safely browse other websites during this time. If your file is taking longer than 30 minutes to upload, you’ll need to upload again as the video conversion process can sometimes get stuck.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Preferred by many as a great free online video reverser tool</li>
<li>All you need is a modern web browser and that’s it</li>
<li>Very simple to use even for those who have never done any video reversing online</li>
<li>Works seamlessly with iPhone, Android, Windows and Mac devices</li>
<li>Option to manually remove files from the Resizegram server</li>
<li>No registration required – just upload your file and enjoy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even though the 500MB file size cap seems generous enough, it may not be sufficient for some ‘power’ reverse video creators</li>
<li>The upload process can be slow, especially the larger your file size is towards the above cap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In closing</strong></p>
<p>With a myriad of free online video reverser tools to choose from, there are options a plenty for everyone – from the most basic of users to advanced users who love to create and market reversed videos for a living.</p>
<p>If the upload file size is an issue for you, for example, then you may prefer certain online reverse video makers over others. All in all, each one of the above we’ve reviewed should give you plenty of options to play around with, as you and your audience or friends get entertained over some reverse video silliness!</p>
