<p>Post-production always takes time regardless of how large or small your project is, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start promoting your movie before you complete it. In fact, filmmakers have been using movie trailers for years to inform the audience about their upcoming projects.</p>
<p>There is no need to spend money on a movie trailer maker since the video editing software you’re using to edit the footage can also be used to create trailers for videos you are working on. Even so, there are so many different video editing software products for Macs and PCs, that finding the one that is best suited for your video editing needs can be difficult. That is why in this article we are going to take you through the ten best trailer makers for Mac and Windows operating systems.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Movie-Trailer-Software-for-PC-and-Mac-Computers"><a href="#Best-Movie-Trailer-Software-for-PC-and-Mac-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Best Movie Trailer Software for PC and Mac Computers"></a>Best Movie Trailer Software for PC and Mac Computers</h2><p>Mastering a short video form like a movie trailer takes a lot of practice, as you only have a limited amount of time to tell your story. Each of the video editing software products we featured in this article grants you access to all the tools you’re going to need to tell your stories, but it is up to you which ones you are going to use to make your next movie trailer. So, let’s take a look at what best movie trailer makers for Mac and PC have to offer.</p>
<h3 id="1-iMovie"><a href="#1-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, iOS</p>
<p>Mac, iPhone and iPad users have a free and easy solution at their disposal if they want to make movie trailers. Besides offering basic video editing tools that enable you to edit your footage quickly, iMovie also features a collection of trailer templates. So, all you need to do in order to make a movie trailer is to add the video clips and insert the title of the movie, the director’s name and create the end credits.</p>
<p>None of the movie trailer templates you can find in iMovie allow you to add music to them, although you can create the soundtrack for your trailer from iMovie’s Movie mode. Furthermore, the templates can limit the maximum duration of your trailer, which is why you must make sure that the video clips you want to use match the duration of the trailer you selected.</p>

<p>Post-production always takes time regardless of how large or small your project is, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start promoting your movie before you complete it. In fact, filmmakers have been using movie trailers for years to inform the audience about their upcoming projects.</p>
<p>There is no need to spend money on a movie trailer maker since the video editing software you’re using to edit the footage can also be used to create trailers for videos you are working on. Even so, there are so many different video editing software products for Macs and PCs, that finding the one that is best suited for your video editing needs can be difficult. That is why in this article we are going to take you through the ten best trailer makers for Mac and Windows operating systems.</p>

<p>Mac, iPhone and iPad users have a free and easy solution at their disposal if they want to make movie trailers. Besides offering basic video editing tools that enable you to edit your footage quickly, iMovie also features a collection of trailer templates. So, all you need to do in order to make a movie trailer is to add the video clips and insert the title of the movie, the director’s name and create the end credits.</p>
<p>None of the movie trailer templates you can find in iMovie allow you to add music to them, although you can create the soundtrack for your trailer from iMovie’s Movie mode. Furthermore, the templates can limit the maximum duration of your trailer, which is why you must make sure that the video clips you want to use match the duration of the trailer you selected.</p>

<p>Mac, iPhone and iPad users have a free and easy solution at their disposal if they want to make movie trailers. Besides offering basic video editing tools that enable you to edit your footage quickly, iMovie also features a collection of trailer templates. So, all you need to do in order to make a movie trailer is to add the video clips and insert the title of the movie, the director’s name and create the end credits.</p>
<p>None of the movie trailer templates you can find in iMovie allow you to add music to them, although you can create the soundtrack for your trailer from iMovie’s Movie mode.

Even though most Hollywood trailers look alike, there is no fixed recipe you have to follow while making a movie trailer for your project. However, there a few guidelines that can help you convey the core messages of your movie to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="1-Don’t-Reveal-Too-Much-2"><a href="#1-Don’t-Reveal-Too-Much-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Reveal Too Much"></a>1. Don’t Reveal Too Much</h3><p>A movie trailer only needs to suggest what the movie is about, not tell its entire story. That’s why adopting the Less is More rule can be quite helpful during the process of making a movie trailer. Show just enough to spark the audience’s curiosity, because if you reveal too much they might feel as if they have already seen the best parts of your movie.</p>
<h3 id="2-Find-Creative-Ways-to-Use-Narration-and-Text-2"><a href="#2-Find-Creative-Ways-to-Use-Narration-and-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text"></a>2. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text</h3><p>Giving the audience all the information they need solely through images isn’t always possible, which is the reason why nearly all movie trailers have a narrator. Recording a voiceover and using text to convey the information about the movie to the audience will make the trailer more informative and a better promotional tool.</p>
<h3 id="3-Make-a-Soundtrack-2"><a href="#3-Make-a-Soundtrack-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Make a Soundtrack"></a>3. Make a Soundtrack</h3><p>Sound can give rhythm to a movie trailer, but it can also build suspense or suggest that something horrible is about to happen, which is why you shouldn’t hesitate to add audio effects or music to movie trailers you are making. The sound effects and the music must match the video perfectly in order for your trailer to be effective, which is the reason why you should dedicate special attention to the trailer’s soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The key concepts of making a movie trailer are always the same, regardless of the video editing software you’re using. Each movie trailer maker we featured in this article offers more than enough video editing tools to make a dynamic and captivating movie trailer, but how you are going to use these tools entirely depends on the demands of your project.

Even though most Hollywood trailers look alike, there is no fixed recipe you have to follow while making a movie trailer for your project. However, there a few guidelines that can help you convey the core messages of your movie to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="1-Don’t-Reveal-Too-Much-3"><a href="#1-Don’t-Reveal-Too-Much-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Reveal Too Much"></a>1. Don’t Reveal Too Much</h3><p>A movie trailer only needs to suggest what the movie is about, not tell its entire story. That’s why adopting the Less is More rule can be quite helpful during the process of making a movie trailer. Show just enough to spark the audience’s curiosity, because if you reveal too much they might feel as if they have already seen the best parts of your movie.</p>
<h3 id="2-Find-Creative-Ways-to-Use-Narration-and-Text-3"><a href="#2-Find-Creative-Ways-to-Use-Narration-and-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text"></a>2. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text</h3><p>Giving the audience all the information they need solely through images isn’t always possible, which is the reason why nearly all movie trailers have a narrator. Recording a voiceover and using text to convey the information about the movie to the audience will make the trailer more informative and a better promotional tool.</p>
<h3 id="3-Make-a-Soundtrack-3"><a href="#3-Make-a-Soundtrack-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Make a Soundtrack"></a>3. Make a Soundtrack</h3><p>Sound can give rhythm to a movie trailer, but it can also build suspense or suggest that something horrible is about to happen, which is why you shouldn’t hesitate to add audio effects or music to movie trailers you are making. The sound effects and the music must match the video perfectly in order for your trailer to be effective, which is the reason why you should dedicate special attention to the trailer’s soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The key concepts of making a movie trailer are always the same, regardless of the video editing software you’re using. Each movie trailer maker we featured in this article offers more than enough video editing tools to make a dynamic and captivating movie trailer, but how you are going to use these tools entirely depends on the demands of your project. Which movie trailer maker are you going to choose? Share your opinions with us in the comments.</p>

One is follower ads and other is sponsored ads.</p>
