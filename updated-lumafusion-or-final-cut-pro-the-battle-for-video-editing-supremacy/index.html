<p>Deciding which option to go for when you have two high-performance video editing software like LumaFusion and Final Cut Pro X can be a tough choice to make.</p>
<p>LumaFusion was originally a hands-on video editing app on iOS, adapted to iPad and iPhone alone. At the same time, Final Cut Pro X was designed to run on Mac.</p>
<p>With the recent compatibility of LumaFusion on the M1 MacBook Air, which surfaced in 2020, there have been recent concerns from expert users that very soon, these iOS Pro editing giants may lock horns in no time; if the latter sees more advanced upgrades.</p>

Stick with me as I take you on this brief journey into the creative world of LumaFusion and Final Cut Pro X.</p>

<p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p>
<p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.</p>

<p>During the 90-free trial, you can purchase your Final Cut Pro X, which comes with the Logic Pro built-in for $299, or try the Pro Apps Bundle for Education which has the Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, Compressor, MainStage, and Motion pre-installed for just $199, which gives you a direct and automatic update on purchase. Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p>
<p>Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.</p>
<p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p>

You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>

<p>Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.</p>
<p>However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.</p>

<p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p>
<p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p>
<p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

<p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p>
<p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p>

<p>Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.</p>
<p>However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-2"><a href="#Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Is LumaFusion worth it?</strong></p>
<p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p>
<p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p>
<p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

<p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p>
<p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.</p>

<p>During the 90-free trial, you can purchase your Final Cut Pro X, which comes with the Logic Pro built-in for $299, or try the Pro Apps Bundle for Education which has the Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, Compressor, MainStage, and Motion pre-installed for just $199, which gives you a direct and automatic update on purchase. Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p>
<p>Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.</p>
<p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p>

<p>Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>

You can press this shortcut key for another couple of times depending on the number films you want to use for the split screen effect. Next, drag each film from the bin to their corresponding tracks. <strong>Note:</strong> Make sure NOT to place all the clips on the same track, and that each of them is on a different, its own, video layer.</p>

<p>Select the last video you added to the Timeline (it should be the topmost track), click <strong>Filters</strong> from above the Timeline, click the <strong>+</strong> button from the upper-left corner, click <strong>Size and Position</strong> from the list that appears next, and select the clip’s position from the <strong>Preset</strong> drop-down list.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Adjust Other Videos</strong></p>
<p>Select the second video in the Timeline and repeat the process to set its position, and do the same for all other footages that you added in order to create the split screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Available for FreeBSD, Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms</li>
<li>If using presets, as many as 4 videos can be added for split screen effect</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Working with split screen manually may require practice and some calculations to position the clips on the screen correctly</li>

Some of the most common uses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Showing multiple actions by the same or different characters at the same time, without changing the screen</li>
<li>Comparing multiple objects or picture quality. This can be done only when the entities in question are placed side-by-side</li>
<li>Making your video look more professional</li>
<li>Showing different effects on the same screen</li>
</ul>

Although these tools enable you to resize the videos, since they don’t allow multi-tracked Timelines, no video clips can be placed one above the other which is an essential part for any <strong>split screen video maker</strong> to create the effect. However, as discussed above, there are several post-production tools, offline and online, that allow you to make split screen videos easily and without any cost.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Split screen video editor</strong></a> tools are both paid and free. Regardless of the program you use to create the effect, the output files always look more professional and informative. Furthermore, things become way simpler if the <strong>split screen video maker</strong> has simple UI, is less resource intensive, and is easy to use as it is the case with Wondershare Filmora.</p>

<p>JayCut is a flash-based free online video editor, similar to Yahoo!’s Jumpcut (closed now). It enables people to upload video, audio and more in order to create “mixes” or movies. The most impressive feature is that you can export videos to mobile devices, PC and YouTube. Until now, it’s considered as the best online video editor and is getting better and better since released in 2007.</p>
<p>JayCut has everything you need to have a free video editing trial, including default videos, images and audio. You even don’t need to register to use all the functions. However, once registered, you get free and easier to share movies with family and friends.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: JayCut does all you could imagine in a single web page. Actually, it amazes me and my friends. I like everything about this website. It is very user friendly and allows you to upload different types of media very quickly, and then mix them together. The mixing becomes more of a work of art and one feels a sense of ownership when then have added titles, transitions and music to their pictures or video. Lastly I really like the fact that each person creates his or her own profile page. The profile makes it a fun way of learning about other people and it can be fun because it is similar to Facebook or Myspace.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> If people would expect more, maybe the develop team could add more transitions and text effects, and suit the needs to export to facebook and a choice to select DVD service.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Jaycut is a quick and easy-to-use website video editor. It’s fun and interactive. The design is so intuitive that people could easily understand how to use everything the website offers.</p>

<p>JayCut has everything you need to have a free video editing trial, including default videos, images and audio. You even don’t need to register to use all the functions. However, once registered, you get free and easier to share movies with family and friends.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: JayCut does all you could imagine in a single web page. Actually, it amazes me and my friends. I like everything about this website. It is very user friendly and allows you to upload different types of media very quickly, and then mix them together. The mixing becomes more of a work of art and one feels a sense of ownership when then have added titles, transitions and music to their pictures or video. Lastly I really like the fact that each person creates his or her own profile page. The profile makes it a fun way of learning about other people and it can be fun because it is similar to Facebook or Myspace.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> If people would expect more, maybe the develop team could add more transitions and text effects, and suit the needs to export to facebook and a choice to select DVD service.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Jaycut is a quick and easy-to-use website video editor. It’s fun and interactive. The design is so intuitive that people could easily understand how to use everything the website offers.</p>

<p>JayCut is a flash-based free online video editor, similar to Yahoo!’s Jumpcut (closed now). It enables people to upload video, audio and more in order to create “mixes” or movies. The most impressive feature is that you can export videos to mobile devices, PC and YouTube. Until now, it’s considered as the best online video editor and is getting better and better since released in 2007.</p>
<p>JayCut has everything you need to have a free video editing trial, including default videos, images and audio. You even don’t need to register to use all the functions. However, once registered, you get free and easier to share movies with family and friends.</p>
