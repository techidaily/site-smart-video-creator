<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan" class="headerlink" title="1. VLC Media Player by VideoLan"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.videolan.org/" >VLC Media Player by VideoLan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Over the course of the last two decades, VLC has established itself as one of the most versatile media players ever created. This cross-platform app can be used on Macs, PCs, Linux computers and Smartphones to play different types of audio, image and video files. In fact, VLC is probably the most reliable <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >DVD player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can find, as it allows you to play DVD and Blu-ray discs effortlessly. However, if you want to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >watch videos in 4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or 8K resolution, you must install the VLC 3.0 Vetinari update of the media player.</p>
<p>What’s more, playing a DVD or a Blu-ray with VLC is a simple task you can complete in just a few clicks. The Open Disc option that is located in the player’s Media menu enables you to choose if you would like to open a DVD, VCD, Audio CD or Blu-ray disc. Moreover, you won’t need to install additional  or MPEG-4 codecs, since VLC can play the vast majority of video files regardless of the codec they are using.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Available to all PC and Mac users for free</li>
<li>The most versatile media player on the market</li>
<li>Offers basic video editing options</li>
<li>Powerful subtitle syncing tools</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The playback of 4K or 8K video files can be choppy</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-PotPlayer"><a href="#2-PotPlayer" class="headerlink" title="2. PotPlayer"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://potplayer.daum.net/" >PotPlayer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>If you are looking for a DVD player that is compatible with all versions of Windows that were released since Windows Vista, PotPlayer might be one of your best options. Besides providing support for all commonly used video file formats and allowing you to play DVDs, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Blu-rays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or audio CDs, PotPlayer also offers support for different types of 3D glasses. This Windows-based media player is equipped with enhanced H&#x2F;W Acceleration technology that enables the software to assist the CPU and GPU during the playback of demanding video files.</p>
<p>PotPlayer has all the codecs that are required for the playback of various types of multimedia files, so you don’t have to waste time searching for the codec packs that make possible playing video and audio content that is stored on DVDs or Blu-rays. The media player lets you choose a sound card in case you have more just than one and it supports SRT and SMI, VOB and Blu-ray subtitles.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full OpenCodec support</li>
<li>Provides a unique 3D viewing experience</li>
<li>Enables users to bookmark chapters</li>
<li>Compatible with TV, DVD and HDTV devices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Audio playback options could be better</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-BlazeDVD"><a href="#3-BlazeDVD" class="headerlink" title="3. BlazeDVD"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.blazevideo.com/dvd-player/" >BlazeDVD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This is a powerful multimedia player that enables you to watch even region coded and CSS-encrypted DVDs. However, the free version of BlazeDVD doesn’t allow you to open region coded DVDs and Blu-rays or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add subtitles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to your files. So if you want to gain access to all the features this DVD player has to offer, you must make a one-time payment of $49.96 and upgrade to its Pro version. Both versions of BlazeDVD let you play DVDs, VCDs or SVCDs and allow you to choose between different playback modes.</p>
<p>The Surround Sound support enhances the audio playback and provides a theater-like experience to the viewers. Moreover, you can choose between ten audio filters you can apply to media files you open with BlazeDVD or use the Parental Control feature if you want to restrict the access to violent content to your children.

Simply choose a template from Social Media, Fashion, or Travel categories and upload the images to the template. The number of images you can include in a video trailer varies from template to template, although you can purchase lollies, the platform’s virtual money, that enables you to increase the number of images you can add to a template. Even though all templates have built-in soundtracks, you can add a new song from the platform’s music library or from your computer. LightMV can be used from a web browser, installed as software on a PC computer or downloaded as an app from Google Play or App Store.</p>
