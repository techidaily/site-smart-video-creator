            <h2 id="Apple-Video-Editing-Essentials-Top-Software-Picks"><a href="#Apple-Video-Editing-Essentials-Top-Software-Picks" class="headerlink" title="Apple Video Editing Essentials: Top Software Picks"></a>Apple Video Editing Essentials: Top Software Picks</h2><p>Apple is widely known for its iPhone, iPad, and Macitonsh computer around the world, but do you know that it also provides some fantastic video editing software for creators? In this article, we’ve compiled a list of the best <strong>Apple</strong> <strong>video</strong> <strong>editing</strong> software on the market right now, including free, freemium, and premium solutions.</p>
<p>With these apps, you can modify videos on your smartphones or computers easily. And if you’ve invested in an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max that can capture video in the high-resolution ProRes standard, you’ll find reliable software to make the most of your video. We’ll go over which applications are excellent for specific chores and provide statistics to help you discover the best match. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try"></a>Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try</h2><p>In today’s world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone’s life. Mobile phones, laptops, and cameras may all be used to capture them. But, it might not be easy to organize and decorate them according to one’s unique preferences. Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.</p>
<p>In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.</p>
<h3 id="1-Photos"><a href="#1-Photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Photos"></a>1. Photos</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPadOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>The number one on our list is the Photos app. It’s among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Photos App?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.</p>
<p>Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to <strong>add text</strong>, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can <strong>rotate, crop and auto enhance</strong> videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap <strong>Revert</strong> to restore to the original version.</p>
<p>If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can <strong>adjust the focus points and the depth of the field</strong> in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo’s time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2. QuickTime Player</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that’s not to say this one doesn’t have excellent features to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trim, Combine,</strong> <strong>Rotate, Split MOV Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record Screen and Voiceover</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you think your video footage can do well with a background voiceover of someone else, QuickTime Player allows you to record your audios in the background while your video plays smoothly. You can also record the desktop screen with the Player.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shrink Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe your video looks better with a small size in appearance, try shrinking it using the shrink feature in the QuickTime Player. You can lower the video quality from 1080p, 720p to whatever your phone or Mac storage deems compatible.</p>

<p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p>
<p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.</p>

<p>During the 90-free trial, you can purchase your Final Cut Pro X, which comes with the Logic Pro built-in for $299, or try the Pro Apps Bundle for Education which has the Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, Compressor, MainStage, and Motion pre-installed for just $199, which gives you a direct and automatic update on purchase. Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p>
<p>Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.</p>
<p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p>

<p>Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>

<p>Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.</p>
<p>However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion"><a href="#Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion" class="headerlink" title="Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Is LumaFusion worth it?</strong></p>
<p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p>
<p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p>
<p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

<p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p>
<p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.</p>

Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p>
<p>Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.</p>
<p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p>

<p>Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>

<p>Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.</p>
<p>However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.</p>

<p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p>
<p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p>
<p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation"></a>Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation</h2><p> <strong>Step 1  Put forward an idea</strong></p>
<p>A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.</p>
<p>It will help if you <strong>decide the gist</strong> of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-01.gif"
                      alt="Put forward an idea"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 2  Make a storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After all the ideas are fixed, you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/" >make a storyboard for animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You don’t need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a step that you should not neglect during the preliminary.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-02.gif"
                      alt="make storyboard"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 3  Produce materials</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to prepare all the 2D animation materials, including characters, background, and props. One thing you need to know is all the preparations in steps 2 and 3 should be ready before proceeding to step 3.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-03.gif"
                      alt="Produce materials"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4  Animation</strong></p>
<p>After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation"

<p> <strong>Step 5  Animation editing</strong></p>
<p>In this step, the software is the key to relive the 2D animation. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background audio is essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and needs to be added to the video. Color correction and grading are also necessary. Besides, scene transition, voiceover, and even text credit need to be added.</p>
<p>Above are the five 2D animation steps. If you think there are extra steps, you are free to add them according to your needs.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation"></a>Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation</h2><p> <strong>Step 1  Put forward an idea</strong></p>
<p>A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.</p>
<p>It will help if you <strong>decide the gist</strong> of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-01.gif"
                      alt="Put forward an idea"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 2  Make a storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After all the ideas are fixed, you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/" >make a storyboard for animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You don’t need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a step that you should not neglect during the preliminary.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-02.gif"
                      alt="make storyboard"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 3  Produce materials</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to prepare all the 2D animation materials, including characters, background, and props. One thing you need to know is all the preparations in steps 2 and 3 should be ready before proceeding to step 3.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-03.gif"
                      alt="Produce materials"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4  Animation</strong></p>
<p>After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 5  Animation editing</strong></p>
<p>In this step, the software is the key to relive the 2D animation. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background audio is essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and needs to be added to the video. Color correction and grading are also necessary. Besides, scene transition, voiceover, and even text credit need to be added.</p>
<p>Above are the five 2D animation steps. If you think there are extra steps, you are free to add them according to your needs.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation"></a>Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation</h2><p> <strong>Step 1  Put forward an idea</strong></p>
<p>A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.</p>
<p>It will help if you <strong>decide the gist</strong> of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-01.gif"
                      alt="Put forward an idea"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 2  Make a storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After all the ideas are fixed, you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/" >make a storyboard for animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You don’t need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a step that you should not neglect during the preliminary.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-02.gif"
                      alt="make storyboard"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 3  Produce materials</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to prepare all the 2D animation materials, including characters, background, and props. One thing you need to know is all the preparations in steps 2 and 3 should be ready before proceeding to step 3.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Produce materials"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4  Animation</strong></p>
<p>After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-04.gif"
                      alt="Animation"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 5  Animation editing</strong></p>
<p>In this step, the software is the key to relive the 2D animation. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background audio is essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and needs to be added to the video. Color correction and grading are also necessary. Besides, scene transition, voiceover, and even text credit need to be added.</p>
<p>Above are the five 2D animation steps. If you think there are extra steps, you are free to add them according to your needs.</p>

<p>A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.</p>
<p>It will help if you <strong>decide the gist</strong> of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.</p>

You don’t need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a step that you should not neglect during the preliminary.</p>

                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 3  Produce materials</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to prepare all the 2D animation materials, including characters, background, and props. One thing you need to know is all the preparations in steps 2 and 3 should be ready before proceeding to step 3.</p>

                      alt="Produce materials"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4  Animation</strong></p>
<p>After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.</p>

                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 5  Animation editing</strong></p>
<p>In this step, the software is the key to relive the 2D animation. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background audio is essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and needs to be added to the video. Color correction and grading are also necessary. Besides, scene transition, voiceover, and even text credit need to be added.</p>
<p>Above are the five 2D animation steps. If you think there are extra steps, you are free to add them according to your needs.</p>

However, we can give you some recommendations based on your needs. If you are a beginner, <strong>Pencil 2D</strong> is a great start. You can use it to make minimalist animation to give you a quick-to-start 2D animation experience. If you are in the middle level, <strong>Stop Motion Studio</strong> is what we recommend. The interface is intuitive with powerful features like voiceover and Chroma key.</p>

It is your call for the final decision.</p>
