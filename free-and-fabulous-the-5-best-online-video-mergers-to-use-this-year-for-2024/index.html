<p>The videos you record with your phone often don’t last very long, which makes it a bit difficult to tell the entire story of the scene you captured. Fortunately, there are more than a few simple ways to combine and merge multiple clips, that don’t involve using professional video editing apps. So even if you are a newcomer to the world of video content production you won’t have any trouble creating social media videos. That’s why in this article we are going to present to you some of the best online platforms that enable you to merge your video clips effortlessly.</p>

<h2 id="The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022"><a href="#The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022"></a>The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022</h2><p>The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger. In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.</p>
<h4 id="1-Merge-Video"><a href="#1-Merge-Video" class="headerlink" title="1. Merge Video"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mergevideo.online/" >Merge Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>
<h4 id="3-Aconvert"><a href="#3-Aconvert" class="headerlink" title="3. Aconvert"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/" >Aconvert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.</p>
<h4 id="4-Kapwing"><a href="#4-Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="4. Kapwing"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kapwing.com/maker/editor" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/video-effect/kapwing_1.jpg"
                      alt="kapwing_1"
                ></p>
<p>The wide range of video editing tools that the Kapwing offers makes it one of the best online video editors. You can use Kapwing to make video montages, crop videos, rotate them or perform any other basic video editing action without even having an account on the platform. In order to start merging the video clips you just have to select the Video Maker option, upload video files from an online source or from your computer and arrange them in any way you want. The platform also lets you choose the aspect ratio of the output video which enables you to create vertical or square videos effortlessly. Simply click on the Create! button when you are ready to export the video, and wait for the new file to be generated. Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.</p>
<h4 id="5-Cellsea"><a href="#5-Cellsea" class="headerlink" title="5. Cellsea"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cellsea.com/free-online-video-editor" >Cellsea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Cellsea is a platform where you can create your own ringtones, edit photos or merge videos for free. Its video editing tools enable you to cut, trim or resize videos, which makes it quite useful in case you want to polish your video before sharing it on social media. To start merging several video clips you just have to upload those files to Cellsea, but unfortunately, you can only upload files that are stored on your computer. When done, you can choose the output format of the video file and save it as mov, mp4, flv 3gp or avi file. The platform lets you download the results to your computer or you can choose to send them to your phone.</p>
<h4 id="6-FlexClip"><a href="#6-FlexClip" class="headerlink" title="6. FlexClip"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.flexclip.com/features/video-merger.html" >FlexClip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Before you can start piecing together your video clips with this online video editing tool, you must first create an account or use your Google and Facebook accounts to sign in. You can then create a new project and once the editing window loads you can start adding video clips to the storyboard. Besides enabling you to upload videos from your computer, FlexClip also offers a rich selection of stock footage you can use in your projects, but you must keep in mind that the platform won’t let you upload videos that are longer than one minute. You can change the position of the video clip by dragging it to a new location in the storyboard and you can also use FlexClip’s music library to add sound to your video. Hit the Export button after you’ve arranged the video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the video and proceed to pick a 480p, 720p or 1080p output quality.</p>

So even if you are a newcomer to the world of video content production you won’t have any trouble creating social media videos. That’s why in this article we are going to present to you some of the best online platforms that enable you to merge your video clips effortlessly.</p>

<h2 id="The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022-1"><a href="#The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022-1" class="headerlink" title="The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022"></a>The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022</h2><p>The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger. In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.</p>
<h4 id="1-Merge-Video-1"><a href="#1-Merge-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Merge Video"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mergevideo.online/" >Merge Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>
<h4 id="3-Aconvert-1"><a href="#3-Aconvert-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Aconvert"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/" >Aconvert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.</p>
<h4 id="4-Kapwing-1"><a href="#4-Kapwing-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Kapwing"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kapwing.com/maker/editor" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="kapwing_1"
                ></p>
<p>The wide range of video editing tools that the Kapwing offers makes it one of the best online video editors. You can use Kapwing to make video montages, crop videos, rotate them or perform any other basic video editing action without even having an account on the platform. In order to start merging the video clips you just have to select the Video Maker option, upload video files from an online source or from your computer and arrange them in any way you want. The platform also lets you choose the aspect ratio of the output video which enables you to create vertical or square videos effortlessly. Simply click on the Create! button when you are ready to export the video, and wait for the new file to be generated. Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.</p>
<h4 id="5-Cellsea-1"><a href="#5-Cellsea-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

Its video editing tools enable you to cut, trim or resize videos, which makes it quite useful in case you want to polish your video before sharing it on social media. To start merging several video clips you just have to upload those files to Cellsea, but unfortunately, you can only upload files that are stored on your computer. When done, you can choose the output format of the video file and save it as mov, mp4, flv 3gp or avi file. The platform lets you download the results to your computer or you can choose to send them to your phone.</p>
<h4 id="6-FlexClip-1"><a href="#6-FlexClip-1" class="headerlink" title="6.

You can then create a new project and once the editing window loads you can start adding video clips to the storyboard. Besides enabling you to upload videos from your computer, FlexClip also offers a rich selection of stock footage you can use in your projects, but you must keep in mind that the platform won’t let you upload videos that are longer than one minute. You can change the position of the video clip by dragging it to a new location in the storyboard and you can also use FlexClip’s music library to add sound to your video. Hit the Export button after you’ve arranged the video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the video and proceed to pick a 480p, 720p or 1080p output quality.</p>

Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.</p>

Its video editing tools enable you to cut, trim or resize videos, which makes it quite useful in case you want to polish your video before sharing it on social media. To start merging several video clips you just have to upload those files to Cellsea, but unfortunately, you can only upload files that are stored on your computer. When done, you can choose the output format of the video file and save it as mov, mp4, flv 3gp or avi file. The platform lets you download the results to your computer or you can choose to send them to your phone.</p>

You can then create a new project and once the editing window loads you can start adding video clips to the storyboard. Besides enabling you to upload videos from your computer, FlexClip also offers a rich selection of stock footage you can use in your projects, but you must keep in mind that the platform won’t let you upload videos that are longer than one minute. You can change the position of the video clip by dragging it to a new location in the storyboard and you can also use FlexClip’s music library to add sound to your video. Hit the Export button after you’ve arranged the video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the video and proceed to pick a 480p, 720p or 1080p output quality.</p>

<p>“I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?”</p>
<p>We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn’t have any problem finding some that you can use to <strong>AIFF converter</strong>!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-So-Good-About-AIFF"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-So-Good-About-AIFF" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s So Good About AIFF?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What’s So Good About AIFF?</strong></h2><p>But okay, what’s the deal with AIFF? Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we’ve prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you’d prefer to see the tutorial on <strong>AIFF Converters</strong> or our list of recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-AIFF"><a href="#01What’s-AIFF" class="headerlink" title="01What’s AIFF?"></a>01<strong>What’s AIFF?</strong></h3><p>AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It’s accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-Is-It-So-Popular"><a href="#02Why-Is-It-So-Popular" class="headerlink" title="02Why Is It So Popular?"></a>02<strong>Why Is It So Popular?</strong></h3><p>Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one’s disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.</p>

The benefit of using an online converter like the one we’ll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient. This makes it a perfect solution for those who are just looking to convert to or from AIFF occasionally and thus has no need for a more permanent solution.</p>

For our example, we’ve chosen FreeConvert, but there are plenty of other ones out there for you to choose from</p>
<p>Once you’re on-site, make use of the upload options to prepare your file to be converted. In this case, we uploaded an MP3 file, but it will work for M4A to AIFF just as well (along with other file formats.)</p>

<p>**<strong>3. Online Converter</strong></p>
<p>The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It’s more limited though — in that it doesn’t support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.</p>

<p>For this next <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it’s capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion</p>

<p>**<strong>5. EaseUS Video Converter</strong></p>
<p>With ‘EaseUS Video Converter’ we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it’s closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It’s a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.</p>

<p>**<strong>6. Wondershare UniConverter</strong></p>
<p>This next software, the ‘Wondershare UniConverter’ is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.</p>

<p>This is a hidden feature that not many people know about, but iTunes actually works as a pretty serviceable <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>. It’s not the most efficient, but with iTunes’ AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).</p>

<p>Last, but not least, is Convertio We circle back with this fourth and last online converter It’s actually quite advanced. Although, just like many of the other FREEmium online converters we’ve listed, it’s not 100% FREE and comes with a lot of limitations.</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The AIFF file format is notable because it results in higher-quality sound. This is because AIFF, unlike the more general, MP3 file format, is not a compressed format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are various ways that you can convert from and to the AIFF file format. The first method that we introduced was an online tool that would be available for use no matter what computer or device you’re using The second was chosen specifically because it was FREE and available for both Windows and Mac</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in looking through other options, the ten other converters we introduced should provide a healthy lot for you to choose from — with various levels of usefulness depending on what you need an <strong>AIFF Converter.</strong></p>

<p>“I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?”</p>
<p>We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn’t have any problem finding some that you can use to <strong>AIFF converter</strong>!</p>

Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we’ve prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you’d prefer to see the tutorial on <strong>AIFF Converters</strong> or our list of recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-AIFF-1"><a href="#01What’s-AIFF-1" class="headerlink" title="01What’s AIFF?"></a>01<strong>What’s AIFF?</strong></h3><p>AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It’s accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-1"><a href="#02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-1" class="headerlink" title="02Why Is It So Popular?"></a>02<strong>Why Is It So Popular?</strong></h3><p>Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one’s disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.</p>

The benefit of using an online converter like the one we’ll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient. This makes it a perfect solution for those who are just looking to convert to or from AIFF occasionally and thus has no need for a more permanent solution.</p>

For our example, we’ve chosen FreeConvert, but there are plenty of other ones out there for you to choose from</p>
<p>Once you’re on-site, make use of the upload options to prepare your file to be converted. In this case, we uploaded an MP3 file, but it will work for M4A to AIFF just as well (along with other file formats.)</p>

<p>The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It’s more limited though — in that it doesn’t support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.</p>

<p>For this next <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it’s capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion</p>

<p>With ‘EaseUS Video Converter’ we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it’s closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It’s a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.</p>

<p>Next up, we have VSDC VSDC is a FREE Audio Converter. It’s pretty old-school (as is perhaps evident from the UI example) but it supports a variety of audio formats, including AIFF, which earned it a spot on this list of ours</p>

<p>This is a hidden feature that not many people know about, but iTunes actually works as a pretty serviceable <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>. It’s not the most efficient, but with iTunes’ AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).</p>

<p>Last, but not least, is Convertio We circle back with this fourth and last online converter It’s actually quite advanced. Although, just like many of the other FREEmium online converters we’ve listed, it’s not 100% FREE and comes with a lot of limitations.</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-1"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-1" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The AIFF file format is notable because it results in higher-quality sound. This is because AIFF, unlike the more general, MP3 file format, is not a compressed format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are various ways that you can convert from and to the AIFF file format. The first method that we introduced was an online tool that would be available for use no matter what computer or device you’re using The second was chosen specifically because it was FREE and available for both Windows and Mac</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in looking through other options, the ten other converters we introduced should provide a healthy lot for you to choose from — with various levels of usefulness depending on what you need an <strong>AIFF Converter.</strong></p>

<p>We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn’t have any problem finding some that you can use to <strong>AIFF converter</strong>!</p>

Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we’ve prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you’d prefer to see the tutorial on <strong>AIFF Converters</strong> or our list of recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-AIFF-2"><a href="#01What’s-AIFF-2" class="headerlink" title="01What’s AIFF?"></a>01<strong>What’s AIFF?</strong></h3><p>AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It’s accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-2"><a href="#02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-2" class="headerlink" title="02Why Is It So Popular?"></a>02<strong>Why Is It So Popular?</strong></h3><p>Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one’s disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.</p>

The benefit of using an online converter like the one we’ll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient. This makes it a perfect solution for those who are just looking to convert to or from AIFF occasionally and thus has no need for a more permanent solution.</p>

For our example, we’ve chosen FreeConvert, but there are plenty of other ones out there for you to choose from</p>
<p>Once you’re on-site, make use of the upload options to prepare your file to be converted. In this case, we uploaded an MP3 file, but it will work for M4A to AIFF just as well (along with other file formats.)</p>

<p>The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It’s more limited though — in that it doesn’t support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.</p>

<p>For this next <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it’s capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion</p>

<p>With ‘EaseUS Video Converter’ we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it’s closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It’s a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.</p>

<p>This is a hidden feature that not many people know about, but iTunes actually works as a pretty serviceable <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>. It’s not the most efficient, but with iTunes’ AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).</p>

<p>Last, but not least, is Convertio We circle back with this fourth and last online converter It’s actually quite advanced. Although, just like many of the other FREEmium online converters we’ve listed, it’s not 100% FREE and comes with a lot of limitations.</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-2"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-2" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The AIFF file format is notable because it results in higher-quality sound. This is because AIFF, unlike the more general, MP3 file format, is not a compressed format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are various ways that you can convert from and to the AIFF file format. The first method that we introduced was an online tool that would be available for use no matter what computer or device you’re using The second was chosen specifically because it was FREE and available for both Windows and Mac</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in looking through other options, the ten other converters we introduced should provide a healthy lot for you to choose from — with various levels of usefulness depending on what you need an <strong>AIFF Converter.</strong></p>

<p>We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn’t have any problem finding some that you can use to <strong>AIFF converter</strong>!</p>

Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we’ve prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you’d prefer to see the tutorial on <strong>AIFF Converters</strong> or our list of recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-AIFF-3"><a href="#01What’s-AIFF-3" class="headerlink" title="01What’s AIFF?"></a>01<strong>What’s AIFF?</strong></h3><p>AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It’s accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-3"><a href="#02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-3" class="headerlink" title="02Why Is It So Popular?"></a>02<strong>Why Is It So Popular?</strong></h3><p>Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one’s disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.</p>

The benefit of using an online converter like the one we’ll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient. This makes it a perfect solution for those who are just looking to convert to or from AIFF occasionally and thus has no need for a more permanent solution.</p>

For our example, we’ve chosen FreeConvert, but there are plenty of other ones out there for you to choose from</p>
<p>Once you’re on-site, make use of the upload options to prepare your file to be converted. In this case, we uploaded an MP3 file, but it will work for M4A to AIFF just as well (along with other file formats.)</p>

<p>The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It’s more limited though — in that it doesn’t support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.</p>

<p>For this next <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it’s capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion</p>

<p>With ‘EaseUS Video Converter’ we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it’s closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It’s a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.</p>

Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p>

<h3 id="Part-3-FAQs-About-Game-Download-Sites-1"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-About-Game-Download-Sites-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites"></a>Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites</h3><h4 id="1-Where-can-I-download-PC-games-for-free-1"><a href="#1-Where-can-I-download-PC-games-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-1"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-1" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-1"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p>

<h3 id="Part-3-FAQs-About-Game-Download-Sites-2"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-About-Game-Download-Sites-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites"></a>Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites</h3><h4 id="1-Where-can-I-download-PC-games-for-free-2"><a href="#1-Where-can-I-download-PC-games-for-free-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-2"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-2" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-2"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p>

<h3 id="Part-3-FAQs-About-Game-Download-Sites-3"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-About-Game-Download-Sites-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites"></a>Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites</h3><h4 id="1-Where-can-I-download-PC-games-for-free-3"><a href="#1-Where-can-I-download-PC-games-for-free-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-3"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-3" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-3"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p>
