<p>Size, formats, and resolution… What are pixels exactly doing with it?</p>

<p>So let’s review some basics on pixel calculator ratio to create an easy life, your workflow more productive, and your photos of the ideal size for the intended purpose.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?</h2><p>A digital image is not a single non-dividable thing. You’ll see that your photo is like a mosaic formed by small tiles if you zoom in far enough, which are known as pixels in photography.</p>
<p>The amount of these pixels and the way they are divided are the two elements that you’re required to take into account to know more about the resolution and <strong>pixel</strong> <strong>calculator ratio</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pixel Aspect Ratio is simply the latest way of defining the length of one side of a pixel in context to the length of the other.</p>
<p>Let’s say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.</p>
<p>If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The ‘Aspect Ratio’ does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its “relative” size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it. But if the <strong>Pixel Calculator Ratio</strong> is 1:1, then the pixels will always be square irrespective of the size of that particular photo.</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p>This <strong>pixel ratio calculator</strong> converts pixel dimensions to aspect ratios. It is an online free tool that assists you in calculating the aspect ratio value of an object or a photo.</p>
<p>The conversion can be carried in both ways, aspect ratio to pixels and pixels to aspect ratio. This screen resolution calculator offers a powerful and simple tool that can convert the ratio of images to pixels resolution and pixels to ratio dimensions.</p>
<p>You need to provide Pixels Width and Pixels Height to calculate the aspect ratio; the aspect ratio will be automatically calculated.</p>
<p>You need to provide Ratio Height and Ratio Width to calculate pixel resolutions. Both the Pixels Width and Height will get automatically calculated.</p>

<p>As we already discussed, an aspect ratio defines width to height. The still picture and video frames have a frame aspect ratio. The pixels that create the frame have a pixel aspect ratio (sometimes called PAR).</p>
<p>Different video recording standards have different aspect ratios. For instance, you record video for television in either a 16:9 or a 4:3 frame aspect ratio.</p>
<p>You set the frame and pixel aspect when you create a project in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you set these ratios, you can’t change them for that project. However, you can edit the aspect ratio of a sequence. You can also use assets made with different aspect ratios in the project.</p>
<p>Premiere Pro automatically compensates for the pixel aspect ratio of source files.</p>
<p>If an asset still feels distorted, you can manually mention its pixel aspect ratio. But that isn’t very clear, especially for a beginner. This is why we recommend doing the following.</p>

<p>1 - <strong>Pixel aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.</p>
<p>2 - <strong>Display aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>The display aspect ratio (DAR) is the designers’ most frequent aspect ratio and gets generally synced with the general term.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.</p>
<p>Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.</p>
<p>They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.</p>
<p>They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.</p>
<p>3 - <strong>Storage aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.</p>
<p>SAR x PAR &#x3D; DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design"><a href="#Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?"></a>Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?</h2><p>Aspect ratios play a vital part in any project that consists of displaying and capturing photographs, videos, or other image-based files in an ideal manner. The camera’s fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.</p>
<p>And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.</p>
<p>But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.</p>
<p>A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.</p>
<p>In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor’s negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site’s usability.</p>
<p>Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that’s too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor’s want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.</p>
<p>Various <strong>pixel calculator ratios</strong>, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.</p>

You’ll see that your photo is like a mosaic formed by small tiles if you zoom in far enough, which are known as pixels in photography.</p>
<p>The amount of these pixels and the way they are divided are the two elements that you’re required to take into account to know more about the resolution and <strong>pixel</strong> <strong>calculator ratio</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pixel Aspect Ratio is simply the latest way of defining the length of one side of a pixel in context to the length of the other.</p>
<p>Let’s say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.</p>
<p>If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The ‘Aspect Ratio’ does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its “relative” size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it. But if the <strong>Pixel Calculator Ratio</strong> is 1:1, then the pixels will always be square irrespective of the size of that particular photo.</p>

<p>Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.</p>
<p>SAR x PAR &#x3D; DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.</p>

The camera’s fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.</p>
<p>And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.</p>
<p>But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.</p>
<p>A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.</p>
<p>In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor’s negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site’s usability.</p>
<p>Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that’s too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor’s want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.</p>
<p>Various <strong>pixel calculator ratios</strong>, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.</p>

You’ll see that your photo is like a mosaic formed by small tiles if you zoom in far enough, which are known as pixels in photography.</p>
<p>The amount of these pixels and the way they are divided are the two elements that you’re required to take into account to know more about the resolution and <strong>pixel</strong> <strong>calculator ratio</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pixel Aspect Ratio is simply the latest way of defining the length of one side of a pixel in context to the length of the other.</p>
<p>Let’s say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.</p>
<p>If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The ‘Aspect Ratio’ does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its “relative” size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it. But if the <strong>Pixel Calculator Ratio</strong> is 1:1, then the pixels will always be square irrespective of the size of that particular photo.</p>

So, we’d like to suggest a calculator by xwebtools.com.</p>
<p>Here, you can see tabs, namely the <strong>Common Ratios</strong> <strong>Ratio Width</strong>, <strong>Ratio Height</strong>, <strong>Pixels Width</strong>, and <strong>Pixels Height</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p>This <strong>pixel ratio calculator</strong> converts pixel dimensions to aspect ratios. It is an online free tool that assists you in calculating the aspect ratio value of an object or a photo.</p>
<p>The conversion can be carried in both ways, aspect ratio to pixels and pixels to aspect ratio. This screen resolution calculator offers a powerful and simple tool that can convert the ratio of images to pixels resolution and pixels to ratio dimensions.</p>
<p>You need to provide Pixels Width and Pixels Height to calculate the aspect ratio; the aspect ratio will be automatically calculated.</p>
<p>You need to provide Ratio Height and Ratio Width to calculate pixel resolutions. Both the Pixels Width and Height will get automatically calculated.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What-is-Par-pixel-Aspect-Ratio-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Filmora-2"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-Par-pixel-Aspect-Ratio-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 What is Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro&#x2F;Filmora?"></a>Part 3 What is Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro&#x2F;Filmora?</h2><p><strong>Pixel ratio: Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>As we already discussed, an aspect ratio defines width to height. The still picture and video frames have a frame aspect ratio. The pixels that create the frame have a pixel aspect ratio (sometimes called PAR).</p>
<p>Different video recording standards have different aspect ratios. For instance, you record video for television in either a 16:9 or a 4:3 frame aspect ratio.</p>
<p>You set the frame and pixel aspect when you create a project in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you set these ratios, you can’t change them for that project. However, you can edit the aspect ratio of a sequence. You can also use assets made with different aspect ratios in the project.</p>
<p>Premiere Pro automatically compensates for the pixel aspect ratio of source files.</p>
<p>If an asset still feels distorted, you can manually mention its pixel aspect ratio. But that isn’t very clear, especially for a beginner. This is why we recommend doing the following.</p>

<p>1 - <strong>Pixel aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.</p>
<p>2 - <strong>Display aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>The display aspect ratio (DAR) is the designers’ most frequent aspect ratio and gets generally synced with the general term.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.</p>
<p>Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.</p>
<p>They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.</p>
<p>They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.</p>
<p>3 - <strong>Storage aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.</p>
<p>SAR x PAR &#x3D; DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.</p>

<p>Thus, using the Wondershare Filmora along with the <strong>pixel ratio calculator</strong> makes a difference!</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Difference-among-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio-Display-Aspect-Ratio-and-Storage-Aspect-Ratio-3"><a href="#Part-4-Difference-among-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio-Display-Aspect-Ratio-and-Storage-Aspect-Ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio</h2><p>Although the image aspect ratio comes from its width and height, it also contains multiple subsets that help to define image proportions properly.</p>
<p>1 - <strong>Pixel aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.</p>
<p>2 - <strong>Display aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>The display aspect ratio (DAR) is the designers’ most frequent aspect ratio and gets generally synced with the general term.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.</p>
<p>Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.</p>
<p>They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.</p>
<p>They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.</p>
<p>3 - <strong>Storage aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.</p>
<p>SAR x PAR &#x3D; DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design-3"><a href="#Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?"></a>Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?</h2><p>Aspect ratios play a vital part in any project that consists of displaying and capturing photographs, videos, or other image-based files in an ideal manner. The camera’s fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.</p>
<p>And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.</p>
<p>But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.</p>
<p>A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.</p>
<p>In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor’s negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site’s usability.</p>
<p>Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that’s too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor’s want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.</p>
<p>Various <strong>pixel calculator ratios</strong>, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.</p>

<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Stabilize-Video-with-Built-in-Warp-Stabilizer-in-AE"><a href="#Part-1-Stabilize-Video-with-Built-in-Warp-Stabilizer-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE"></a>Part 1: Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE</h2><p>The Warp Stabilizer effect is a new technique to cope with unsteady video. In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg"
                      alt="after effects effects presets pane"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-warp-stabilizer-vfx.jpg"
                      alt="after effects warp stabilizer vfx"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.</p>
<p>(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE"><a href="#Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE"></a>Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE</h2><p>Using Stabilize Motion feature to stabilize video is an old-school heritage function from the era of the Creative Suite, it will still be there in After Effects presently and performs admirably.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn’t, go to <strong>Window</strong> in the top menu to open it. Once you’ve arrived here, scroll to the bottom until you locate <strong>Tracker</strong> and double-check that it has a checkbox beside it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-tracker-pane.jpg"
                      alt="after effects tracker pane"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Stabilize Motion from the drop-down menu whenever the tracker panel is open. You’ll see that a tracker box appears in your <strong>Layer Panel</strong> once you’ve done this.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: You’ll need to identify a proper location in your film for the tracker to operate at this stage. We’re monitoring a vehicle using a camera operator’s drone in the instance below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="after effects tracker track motion"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Let’s press the <strong>Play</strong> button on the tracker panel once we’ve set up the tracker box. The tracker box should adhere to the location or item you chose when you do this.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: When your tracking points start to go astray, use the <strong>Pause</strong> button, personally modify the tracking point, and then push play to resume the journey).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adobe effects track motion effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When the tracker is done and satisfied with the results, click <strong>Edit target</strong> to verify that the tracking data is transferred to the correct layer. Then proceed to the bottom of the page and click the <strong>Apply</strong> option.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong> A dialogue window with choices for applying them. Usually, you’ll want to choose <strong>X and Y</strong> here).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit target track motion feature"
                ></p>
<p>Hit the spacebar to evaluate how well the stabilize motion tracker performed now when you’re back in the composition window. When you’re not pleased with the outcomes, you might have to go back to try again. Although this approach is best used for photos with a clear point of focus that doesn’t go out of frame, it could still be helpful in some situations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Using-Stabilization-Plugins-for-Smoother-Video-in-AE"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Stabilization-Plugins-for-Smoother-Video-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE"></a>Part 3: Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE</h2><p>As a graphic and motion designer, animator, or 3D artist, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >After Effects plugins <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may completely change the way you operate. Since it can handle so much right out of the box, Adobe After Effects CC is already a go-to motion graphic and compositing program for many artists.</p>
<p>However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.</p>
<p>It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:</p>
<h3 id="1-Orb"><a href="#1-Orb" class="headerlink" title="1. Orb"></a>1. Orb</h3><p>Orb is focused on generating realistic planets and includes a range of unique features to make planetary creation easy. It utilizes a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot’s great Element 3D plugin, and it employs a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot’s outstanding Element 3D plugin.</p>
<p>You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you’re done! Getting a world to ‘look’ properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.</p>
<p>For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?</p>
<p>Although Orb doesn’t work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.</p>
<h3 id="2-Depth-of-Field-Generator-PRO-DOF-PRO"><a href="#2-Depth-of-Field-Generator-PRO-DOF-PRO" class="headerlink" title="2. Depth of Field Generator PRO (DOF PRO)"></a>2. <strong>Depth of Field Generator PRO (DOF PRO)</strong></h3><p>Richard Rosenman’s renowned Photoshop depth of field generator plugin, DOF PRO (Depth of Field Generator PRO), is now downloadable for After Effects. DOF PRO has become the industry’s professional option for an unprecedented and complex depth of field effects rapidly and effectively as a post-process.</p>
<p>This is thanks to almost a decade of discovery and application since the first launch in 2005. DOF PRO’s cutting-edge characteristics offer new and advanced technologies not found anywhere else, resulting in one of the industry’s most potent and sophisticated depth of field processors.</p>
<p>Capability for chromatic and achromatic aberration, focal plane bokeh distinction, astigmatism and vignetting effects, bespoke aperture maps, and noise recovery are among the advanced features.</p>
<p>There will also be compatibility with the alpha channel and transparency, 32-bit floating-point color, correct aperture displays, and an iris array display. A feature comparison between the plugin and After Effects’ Camera Lens Blur effect can be found here.</p>
<h3 id="3-ReelSteady"><a href="#3-ReelSteady" class="headerlink" title="3. ReelSteady"></a>3. ReelSteady</h3><p>ReelSteady for After Effects is a recent addition to the stabilization marketplace. ReelSteady is similar to After Effects’ warp stabilizer plugin. However, the stabilization in ReelSteady is far superior.</p>
<p>ReelSteady also has several other features that make it ideal for creating next-level tunes. Users may design filters to block off specific sections of your frame. This is useful for removing a subject that travels around the frame a lot.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the After Effects plugin is pretty similar to the warp stabilizer but with a few more features. To begin with, ReelSteady includes a built-in rolling shutter repair tool that operates in tandem with its built-in stabilizer.</p>
<p>The ReelSteady effect is a two-pass effect. For instance, after the effect has been executed for the first time, you will likely wish to level out certain places. You’ll successfully isolate specific parts in the effect to “iron out” sections of the footage.</p>
<p>You would like to record your film at a more excellent resolution than your expected outcome to get the most out of ReelSteady. If you wish to output your video in 4K, you might capture it in 4.6K or 5K. You’ll have some leeway for ReelSteady to work its magic.</p>
<p>ReelSteady’s sole flaw is its high price ($399). ReelSteady is not available in After Effects, unlike some of the other choices on this list. ReelSteady, on the other hand, is the way to go if you would like the smoothest footage imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it’s done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.</p>
<p>However, occasionally those tools aren’t available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize videos</strong> to enhance their video content!</p>

<p>You would like to record your film at a more excellent resolution than your expected outcome to get the most out of ReelSteady. If you wish to output your video in 4K, you might capture it in 4.6K or 5K. You’ll have some leeway for ReelSteady to work its magic.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it’s done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.</p>
<p>However, occasionally those tools aren’t available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize videos</strong> to enhance their video content!</p>

<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>

In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>

                      alt="after effects effects presets pane"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="after effects warp stabilizer vfx"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.</p>
<p>(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE-2"><a href="#Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE"></a>Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE</h2><p>Using Stabilize Motion feature to stabilize video is an old-school heritage function from the era of the Creative Suite, it will still be there in After Effects presently and performs admirably.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn’t, go to <strong>Window</strong> in the top menu to open it. Once you’ve arrived here, scroll to the bottom until you locate <strong>Tracker</strong> and double-check that it has a checkbox beside it.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Stabilize Motion from the drop-down menu whenever the tracker panel is open. You’ll see that a tracker box appears in your <strong>Layer Panel</strong> once you’ve done this.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: You’ll need to identify a proper location in your film for the tracker to operate at this stage. We’re monitoring a vehicle using a camera operator’s drone in the instance below).</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Let’s press the <strong>Play</strong> button on the tracker panel once we’ve set up the tracker box. The tracker box should adhere to the location or item you chose when you do this.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: When your tracking points start to go astray, use the <strong>Pause</strong> button, personally modify the tracking point, and then push play to resume the journey).</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When the tracker is done and satisfied with the results, click <strong>Edit target</strong> to verify that the tracking data is transferred to the correct layer. Then proceed to the bottom of the page and click the <strong>Apply</strong> option.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong> A dialogue window with choices for applying them. Usually, you’ll want to choose <strong>X and Y</strong> here).</p>

<p>Hit the spacebar to evaluate how well the stabilize motion tracker performed now when you’re back in the composition window. When you’re not pleased with the outcomes, you might have to go back to try again. Although this approach is best used for photos with a clear point of focus that doesn’t go out of frame, it could still be helpful in some situations.</p>

Since it can handle so much right out of the box, Adobe After Effects CC is already a go-to motion graphic and compositing program for many artists.</p>
<p>However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.</p>
<p>It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:</p>
<h3 id="1-Orb-2"><a href="#1-Orb-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Orb"></a>1.

It utilizes a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot’s great Element 3D plugin, and it employs a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot’s outstanding Element 3D plugin.</p>
<p>You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you’re done! Getting a world to ‘look’ properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.</p>
<p>For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?</p>
<p>Although Orb doesn’t work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.</p>

<p>This is thanks to almost a decade of discovery and application since the first launch in 2005. DOF PRO’s cutting-edge characteristics offer new and advanced technologies not found anywhere else, resulting in one of the industry’s most potent and sophisticated depth of field processors.</p>
<p>Capability for chromatic and achromatic aberration, focal plane bokeh distinction, astigmatism and vignetting effects, bespoke aperture maps, and noise recovery are among the advanced features.</p>
<p>There will also be compatibility with the alpha channel and transparency, 32-bit floating-point color, correct aperture displays, and an iris array display. A feature comparison between the plugin and After Effects’ Camera Lens Blur effect can be found here.</p>

<p>The ReelSteady effect is a two-pass effect. For instance, after the effect has been executed for the first time, you will likely wish to level out certain places. You’ll successfully isolate specific parts in the effect to “iron out” sections of the footage.</p>
<p>You would like to record your film at a more excellent resolution than your expected outcome to get the most out of ReelSteady. If you wish to output your video in 4K, you might capture it in 4.6K or 5K. You’ll have some leeway for ReelSteady to work its magic.</p>
<p>ReelSteady’s sole flaw is its high price ($399). ReelSteady is not available in After Effects, unlike some of the other choices on this list. ReelSteady, on the other hand, is the way to go if you would like the smoothest footage imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it’s done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.</p>
<p>However, occasionally those tools aren’t available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize videos</strong> to enhance their video content!</p>

<p>Both the video of your reaction and the video to which you are reacting must be recorded before you start editing them in Sony Vegas Pro. Making a reaction video with this video editing software is a relatively easy task that only requires you to position your footage correctly on the timeline.</p>
<p>The video containing your reaction should be below the video you are commenting on so that the second video can be treated as an overlay. Click on the Event Pan&#x2F;Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video you’re reacting to. When done, you can proceed to sync both videos so that your reactions correspond with the events in the other video. Don’t forget to preview the reaction video you’ve created before exporting it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers professional video editing tools</li>
<li>Grants users full control over the footage</li>
<li>Intuitive and modernly designed interface</li>

In case you like the result you should click on the Export button and choose the output file format and the destination to which the reaction video will be exported.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No previous video editing experience needed</li>
<li>Offers a rich selection of transitions and visual effects</li>
<li>Videos can be exported directly to YouTube from VSDC in resolutions up to 4K</li>
<li>Offers desktop capturing tools</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lacks advanced video editing tools</li>
<li>Outdated interface design</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-iMovie-3"><a href="#3-iMovie-3" class="headerlink" title="3. iMovie"></a>3. iMovie</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, iPhone, iPad</p>
<p>The process of making a reaction video in iMovie isn’t much different from the process of making any other type of video. Before you start working on your new reaction video, you need to make sure that you have all the media files you want you to use in your project. You can then simply import them into iMovie, and place footage of yourself reacting to a video to the timeline. Afterward, you should place the actual video to which you are reacting above or below the video file that contains the footage of your reaction, depending on which video clip you want to use as a background video.</p>
<p>However, the overlaid video is not going to be automatically visible in the preview screen, so you should just click on the Video Overlay Settings and pick the Picture in Picture option. As soon as you select this option the overlay video will become visible in the preview window, where you can adjust its size and position. When ready, you should export your reaction video and upload it to your channel.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The quick and easy video editing process</li>
<li>Available to all Mac users for free</li>
<li>Excellent for inexperienced video editors</li>
<li>A rich selection of visual effects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No screen capturing tools</li>
<li>Audio editing options could be better</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-OBS-3"><a href="#4-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="4. OBS"></a>4. OBS</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Linux</p>
<p>OBS is a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screencasting software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that enables you to create live streams or record all actions you perform on your computer’s screen. After you launch OBS, you should select the For Recording option, and this reaction video maker will optimize the project settings automatically. Once the OBS’ main window loads, you just have to specify the sources from which you want to record the footage. Simply right-click anywhere within the Sources tab, select the Add option and choose the Display Capture setting from the submenu.</p>
<p>You can then repeat the same process to select Audio Output Capture option, in order to record the audio from the video you’re reacting to. Afterward, you should head over to the Add menu once more and add the Video Capture Device to the Sources tab. Optionally, you can readjust the size of each video source in the Preview Window, and hit the Start Recording button.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free for PC and Mac users</li>
<li>Enables users to specify the format of the output video</li>
<li>Captures videos in HD resolution</li>
<li>Excellent audio recording features</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OBS crashes easily</li>
<li>Not aimed at inexperienced users</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-VegasPro-18-3"><a href="#5-VegasPro-18-3" class="headerlink" title="5. VegasPro 18"></a>5. VegasPro 18</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Freemium</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>Both the video of your reaction and the video to which you are reacting must be recorded before you start editing them in Sony Vegas Pro. Making a reaction video with this video editing software is a relatively easy task that only requires you to position your footage correctly on the timeline.</p>
<p>The video containing your reaction should be below the video you are commenting on so that the second video can be treated as an overlay. Click on the Event Pan&#x2F;Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video you’re reacting to. When done, you can proceed to sync both videos so that your reactions correspond with the events in the other video. Don’t forget to preview the reaction video you’ve created before exporting it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers professional video editing tools</li>
<li>Grants users full control over the footage</li>
<li>Intuitive and modernly designed interface</li>
<li>Supports a broad range of output file formats</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aimed only at professional video editors</li>
<li>Capturing a computer screen with Sony Vegas Pro is not possible</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In order to gather thousands of views, comments, and likes, every detail in your reaction videos needs to be perfect. Video reaction makers we featured in this article enable you to have complete creative control over the process of making a reaction video.</p>
<p>Among all these above, if you want to go for a free one, I’ll say you should go for <strong>OBS.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to go for a paid one but don’t want to pay too much for it, I’ll suggest you go for <strong>Filmora</strong>, which provides you several ways to create a reaction video easily on Windows and Mac.</p>
