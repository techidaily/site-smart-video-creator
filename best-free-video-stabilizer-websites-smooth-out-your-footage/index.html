<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once you open the Video Stabilizer option, you will be asked to either upload the video you’d like to stabilize from the hard drive on your computer or paste the video’s URL if the clip you want to stabilize is stored online. Hit the Upload Video button after you perform either of these actions and wait for the upload process to be finalized.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To initiate the video stabilization process, you just have to click on the Stabilize button. The process will start automatically and its duration depends on the size of the file you’re stabilizing.</p>

<p>A very simple, yet very effective effect is changing the speed of a video clip. This could be a simple still-frame (also called “Freeze Frame”) or playing a clip in slow or fast motion.</p>
<p>This article shows you how to do this using Final Cut Pro X.</p>

<p>A still-frame freezes action. For instance, here is a clip of a hummingbird getting ready to land on a bird feeder. I want to create a freeze-frame of the bird in flight. (Um, yeah, I use “freeze-frame” and “still-frame” interchangeably.)</p>
<p>In Final Cut Pro X, put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to freeze and type Option+F.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Adjust the duration of the frame by trimming the edge; just like any other clip. Here, for example, I’m making the duration of the freeze-frame 11 frames shorter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed004.jpg"
                      alt="freeze frames in FCP X"
                ></p>
<p>In case you were wondering, this is what the freeze looks like. It freezes the flight of the hummingbird in the middle of playback, allowing us to add graphics or other text then resume the action as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Very cool, except….</p>
<p>Well, the good news is that this is fast and easy. The bad news is that we can’t change the location of the still frame.</p>
<p>So, here’s another way to do this.</p>
<p>Put the playhead (or skimmer, but I prefer the playhead) on the frame you want to freeze, select the clip, then type Shift+F.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed005.jpg"
                      alt="Playhead"
                ></p>
<p>This locates the source clip in the Browser, selects both the Browser and the clip, and matches the position of the In, Out, and playhead.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed006.jpg"
                      alt="match clips"
                ></p>
<p>Now, with the Browser selected, type Option+F. This creates a freeze-frame of the Browser clip and places it at the location of the playhead as a connected clip in the Timeline.</p>
<p>As a connected clip, we can move this new freeze-frame wherever we want. However, be careful in moving the clip, because, unless you mark the original frame with a marker (type “M”), there’s no easy way to match the still frame with the source frame, once the still frame is moved somewhere else.</p>
<p>I use both these techniques in many different projects.</p>
<h4 id="2-HOLD-FRAME"><a href="#2-HOLD-FRAME" class="headerlink" title="2.  HOLD FRAME"></a>2.  HOLD FRAME</h4><p>A Hold Frame is similar to an in-line still frame, but with more flexibility.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed013.jpg"
                      alt="hold frame"
                ></p>
<p>Put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to hold. Then, Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf-on-a-headset” Toolbar icon, choose Hold Frame (or type: Shift+H).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed014.jpg"
                      alt="hold frames in fcp x"
                ></p>
<p>This displays the orange Retime editor bar above the clip, with a small red portion indicating the Hold frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed015.jpg"
                      alt="create hold frames"
                ></p>
<p>Change the duration of the Hold frame by dragging the small thumb at the right end of the red bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="speed016"
                ></p>
<p>Add a speed ramp transition at the end of the Hold frame by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to the word “Hold” in the Retime Editor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="speed018"
                ></p>
<p>To change the actual frame being held, double-click the bar icon to the LEFT of the red Hold section and choose Source Frame (Edit). This allows you to slide the Hold frame selection left or right.</p>
<p>NOTE: Changing the source frame is a feature that I like a LOT!</p>
<h4 id="3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION"><a href="#3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION" class="headerlink" title="3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION"></a>3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION</h4><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed007.jpg" alt="fast/slow motion"></p>
<p>We use slow-motion to show events that are too fast for the unaided eye to see. And fast motion to speed up very slow events. Both of these effects use what’s called a “constant speed change,” where the entire clip changes by the same amount - either faster or slower.</p>
<p>WE create either effect using the same tools, just different values. Here’s how.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed008.jpg"
                      alt="slow motion"
                ></p>
<p>Select the clip who’s speed you want to change. Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” Toolbar icon, select Slow (or Fast).</p>
<p>Choose one of the available speeds; in this case, 50%. (Yes, you can change this to any value you want, I’ll show you how in a minute.)</p>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed009.jpg" alt="create slow/fast motion"></p>
<p>Three things happen at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>The duration of the clip changes</li>
<li>The orange Retiming bar appears over the top of the clip</li>
<li>The speed of the clip changes</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed010.jpg"
                      alt="speed010"
                ></p>
<p>To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).</p>
<p>There are two ways to change the speed of a clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed017.jpg"
                      alt="speed017"
                ></p>
<p>The easy way is to grab the small handle at the end of the clip and drag left or right. The speed will change as you drag it.</p>
<p>Or, for more precision, click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Custom.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed011.jpg"
                      alt="speed011"
                ></p>
<p>This opens a new dialog allowing a number of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse. Plays the clip in reverse.</li>
<li>Rate. Select a specific speed change as a percentage of normal speed for a clip. Less than 100% is slow-motion. More than 100% is fast-motion.</li>
<li>Duration. Select a specific duration for a clip and FCP X will calculate how fast or slow it needs to go.</li>
<li>Ripple. When checked, adjusts the duration of a clip based upon the speed. When unchecked, the clip duration remains fixed even when speed changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the smoothest speed changes when the percentage you choose divides evenly into 200. For example, 100, 66, 50, 40, 33, 25, 20, 10 and so on.</p>
<h4 id="4-EXTRA-CREDIT"><a href="#4-EXTRA-CREDIT" class="headerlink" title="4.  EXTRA CREDIT"></a>4.  EXTRA CREDIT</h4><p>There is one more setting to consider when slowing a clip. (This does not apply when creating fast motion.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed012.jpg"
                      alt="speed012"
                ></p>
<p>Using, again, either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” menu, select Video Quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal. This is the best choice for speeds of 50% or faster.</li>
<li>Frame Blending. This is the best choice for speeds of about 20% to 50%.</li>
<li>Optical Flow. This is the best choice for speeds slower than about 20%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frame blending puts a short dissolve between frames when running in slow motion to improve the illusion of motion. Optical Flow invents in-between frames to minimize the jerkiness of extremely slow motion.</p>
<p>Frame blending is relatively fast and easy. Optical Flow will look better in most cases, but takes a long time to render.</p>

<p>A very simple, yet very effective effect is changing the speed of a video clip. This could be a simple still-frame (also called “Freeze Frame”) or playing a clip in slow or fast motion.</p>
<p>This article shows you how to do this using Final Cut Pro X.</p>

                ></p>
<p>A still-frame freezes action. For instance, here is a clip of a hummingbird getting ready to land on a bird feeder. I want to create a freeze-frame of the bird in flight. (Um, yeah, I use “freeze-frame” and “still-frame” interchangeably.)</p>
<p>In Final Cut Pro X, put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to freeze and type Option+F.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="freeze frames"
                ></p>
<p>This creates a two-second freeze-frame at the position of the playhead.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Adjust the duration of the frame by trimming the edge; just like any other clip. Here, for example, I’m making the duration of the freeze-frame 11 frames shorter.</p>

<p>To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).</p>
<p>There are two ways to change the speed of a clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed017.jpg"
                      alt="speed017"
                ></p>
<p>The easy way is to grab the small handle at the end of the clip and drag left or right. The speed will change as you drag it.</p>
<p>Or, for more precision, click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Custom.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed011.jpg"
                      alt="speed011"
                ></p>
<p>This opens a new dialog allowing a number of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse. Plays the clip in reverse.</li>
<li>Rate. Select a specific speed change as a percentage of normal speed for a clip. Less than 100% is slow-motion. More than 100% is fast-motion.</li>
<li>Duration. Select a specific duration for a clip and FCP X will calculate how fast or slow it needs to go.</li>
<li>Ripple. When checked, adjusts the duration of a clip based upon the speed. When unchecked, the clip duration remains fixed even when speed changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the smoothest speed changes when the percentage you choose divides evenly into 200. For example, 100, 66, 50, 40, 33, 25, 20, 10 and so on.</p>
<h4 id="4-EXTRA-CREDIT-1"><a href="#4-EXTRA-CREDIT-1" class="headerlink" title="4.  EXTRA CREDIT"></a>4.  EXTRA CREDIT</h4><p>There is one more setting to consider when slowing a clip. (This does not apply when creating fast motion.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed012.jpg"
                      alt="speed012"
                ></p>
<p>Using, again, either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” menu, select Video Quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal. This is the best choice for speeds of 50% or faster.</li>
<li>Frame Blending. This is the best choice for speeds of about 20% to 50%.</li>
<li>Optical Flow. This is the best choice for speeds slower than about 20%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frame blending puts a short dissolve between frames when running in slow motion to improve the illusion of motion. Optical Flow invents in-between frames to minimize the jerkiness of extremely slow motion.</p>
<p>Frame blending is relatively fast and easy. Optical Flow will look better in most cases, but takes a long time to render.</p>

<p>A very simple, yet very effective effect is changing the speed of a video clip. This could be a simple still-frame (also called “Freeze Frame”) or playing a clip in slow or fast motion.</p>
<p>This article shows you how to do this using Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p>For more tutorials on slow-motion please refer to this article: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Slow Motion Video Editing Software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

STILL FRAMES"></a>1.  STILL FRAMES</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed001.jpg"
                      alt="still frames"
                ></p>
<p>A still-frame freezes action. For instance, here is a clip of a hummingbird getting ready to land on a bird feeder. I want to create a freeze-frame of the bird in flight. (Um, yeah, I use “freeze-frame” and “still-frame” interchangeably.)</p>
<p>In Final Cut Pro X, put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to freeze and type Option+F.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed002.jpg"
                      alt="freeze frames"
                ></p>
<p>This creates a two-second freeze-frame at the position of the playhead.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed003.jpg"
                      alt="create freeze frame"
                ></p>
<p>Adjust the duration of the frame by trimming the edge; just like any other clip. Here, for example, I’m making the duration of the freeze-frame 11 frames shorter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed004.jpg"
                      alt="freeze frames in FCP X"
                ></p>
<p>In case you were wondering, this is what the freeze looks like. It freezes the flight of the hummingbird in the middle of playback, allowing us to add graphics or other text then resume the action as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Very cool, except….</p>
<p>Well, the good news is that this is fast and easy. The bad news is that we can’t change the location of the still frame.</p>
<p>So, here’s another way to do this.</p>
<p>Put the playhead (or skimmer, but I prefer the playhead) on the frame you want to freeze, select the clip, then type Shift+F.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed005.jpg"
                      alt="Playhead"
                ></p>
<p>This locates the source clip in the Browser, selects both the Browser and the clip, and matches the position of the In, Out, and playhead.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed006.jpg"
                      alt="match clips"
                ></p>
<p>Now, with the Browser selected, type Option+F. This creates a freeze-frame of the Browser clip and places it at the location of the playhead as a connected clip in the Timeline.</p>
<p>As a connected clip, we can move this new freeze-frame wherever we want. However, be careful in moving the clip, because, unless you mark the original frame with a marker (type “M”), there’s no easy way to match the still frame with the source frame, once the still frame is moved somewhere else.</p>
<p>I use both these techniques in many different projects.</p>
<h4 id="2-HOLD-FRAME-2"><a href="#2-HOLD-FRAME-2" class="headerlink" title="2.  HOLD FRAME"></a>2.  HOLD FRAME</h4><p>A Hold Frame is similar to an in-line still frame, but with more flexibility.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed013.jpg"
                      alt="hold frame"
                ></p>
<p>Put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to hold. Then, Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf-on-a-headset” Toolbar icon, choose Hold Frame (or type: Shift+H).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed014.jpg"
                      alt="hold frames in fcp x"
                ></p>
<p>This displays the orange Retime editor bar above the clip, with a small red portion indicating the Hold frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed015.jpg"
                      alt="create hold frames"
                ></p>
<p>Change the duration of the Hold frame by dragging the small thumb at the right end of the red bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed016.jpg"
                      alt="speed016"
                ></p>
<p>Add a speed ramp transition at the end of the Hold frame by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to the word “Hold” in the Retime Editor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed018.jpg"
                      alt="speed018"
                ></p>
<p>To change the actual frame being held, double-click the bar icon to the LEFT of the red Hold section and choose Source Frame (Edit). This allows you to slide the Hold frame selection left or right.</p>
<p>NOTE: Changing the source frame is a feature that I like a LOT!</p>
<h4 id="3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION-2"><a href="#3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION-2" class="headerlink" title="3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION"></a>3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION</h4><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed007.jpg" alt="fast/slow motion"></p>
<p>We use slow-motion to show events that are too fast for the unaided eye to see. And fast motion to speed up very slow events. Both of these effects use what’s called a “constant speed change,” where the entire clip changes by the same amount - either faster or slower.</p>
<p>WE create either effect using the same tools, just different values. Here’s how.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed008.jpg"
                      alt="slow motion"
                ></p>
<p>Select the clip who’s speed you want to change. Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” Toolbar icon, select Slow (or Fast).</p>
<p>Choose one of the available speeds; in this case, 50%. (Yes, you can change this to any value you want, I’ll show you how in a minute.)</p>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed009.jpg" alt="create slow/fast motion"></p>
<p>Three things happen at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>The duration of the clip changes</li>
<li>The orange Retiming bar appears over the top of the clip</li>
<li>The speed of the clip changes</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed010.jpg"
                      alt="speed010"
                ></p>
<p>To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).</p>

                      alt="speed011"

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed003.jpg"
                      alt="create freeze frame"
                ></p>
<p>Adjust the duration of the frame by trimming the edge; just like any other clip. Here, for example, I’m making the duration of the freeze-frame 11 frames shorter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed004.jpg"
                      alt="freeze frames in FCP X"
                ></p>
<p>In case you were wondering, this is what the freeze looks like. It freezes the flight of the hummingbird in the middle of playback, allowing us to add graphics or other text then resume the action as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Very cool, except….</p>
<p>Well, the good news is that this is fast and easy. The bad news is that we can’t change the location of the still frame.</p>
<p>So, here’s another way to do this.</p>
<p>Put the playhead (or skimmer, but I prefer the playhead) on the frame you want to freeze, select the clip, then type Shift+F.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed005.jpg"
                      alt="Playhead"
                ></p>
<p>This locates the source clip in the Browser, selects both the Browser and the clip, and matches the position of the In, Out, and playhead.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed006.jpg"
                      alt="match clips"
                ></p>
<p>Now, with the Browser selected, type Option+F. This creates a freeze-frame of the Browser clip and places it at the location of the playhead as a connected clip in the Timeline.</p>
<p>As a connected clip, we can move this new freeze-frame wherever we want. However, be careful in moving the clip, because, unless you mark the original frame with a marker (type “M”), there’s no easy way to match the still frame with the source frame, once the still frame is moved somewhere else.</p>
<p>I use both these techniques in many different projects.</p>
<h4 id="2-HOLD-FRAME-3"><a href="#2-HOLD-FRAME-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  HOLD FRAME"></a>2.  HOLD FRAME</h4><p>A Hold Frame is similar to an in-line still frame, but with more flexibility.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed013.jpg"
                      alt="hold frame"
                ></p>
<p>Put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to hold. Then, Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf-on-a-headset” Toolbar icon, choose Hold Frame (or type: Shift+H).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed014.jpg"
                      alt="hold frames in fcp x"
                ></p>
<p>This displays the orange Retime editor bar above the clip, with a small red portion indicating the Hold frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed015.jpg"
                      alt="create hold frames"
                ></p>
<p>Change the duration of the Hold frame by dragging the small thumb at the right end of the red bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed016.jpg"
                      alt="speed016"
                ></p>
<p>Add a speed ramp transition at the end of the Hold frame by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to the word “Hold” in the Retime Editor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed018.jpg"
                      alt="speed018"
                ></p>
<p>To change the actual frame being held, double-click the bar icon to the LEFT of the red Hold section and choose Source Frame (Edit). This allows you to slide the Hold frame selection left or right.</p>
<p>NOTE: Changing the source frame is a feature that I like a LOT!</p>
<h4 id="3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION-3"><a href="#3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION"></a>3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION</h4><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed007.jpg" alt="fast/slow motion"></p>
<p>We use slow-motion to show events that are too fast for the unaided eye to see. And fast motion to speed up very slow events. Both of these effects use what’s called a “constant speed change,” where the entire clip changes by the same amount - either faster or slower.</p>
<p>WE create either effect using the same tools, just different values. Here’s how.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed008.jpg"
                      alt="slow motion"
                ></p>
<p>Select the clip who’s speed you want to change. Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” Toolbar icon, select Slow (or Fast).</p>
<p>Choose one of the available speeds; in this case, 50%. (Yes, you can change this to any value you want, I’ll show you how in a minute.)</p>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed009.jpg" alt="create slow/fast motion"></p>
<p>Three things happen at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>The duration of the clip changes</li>
<li>The orange Retiming bar appears over the top of the clip</li>
<li>The speed of the clip changes</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed010.jpg"
                      alt="speed010"
                ></p>
<p>To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).</p>
<p>There are two ways to change the speed of a clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed017.jpg"
                      alt="speed017"
                ></p>
<p>The easy way is to grab the small handle at the end of the clip and drag left or right. The speed will change as you drag it.</p>
<p>Or, for more precision, click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Custom.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed011.jpg"
                      alt="speed011"
                ></p>
<p>This opens a new dialog allowing a number of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse. Plays the clip in reverse.</li>
<li>Rate. Select a specific speed change as a percentage of normal speed for a clip. Less than 100% is slow-motion. More than 100% is fast-motion.</li>
<li>Duration. Select a specific duration for a clip and FCP X will calculate how fast or slow it needs to go.</li>
<li>Ripple. When checked, adjusts the duration of a clip based upon the speed. When unchecked, the clip duration remains fixed even when speed changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the smoothest speed changes when the percentage you choose divides evenly into 200. For example, 100, 66, 50, 40, 33, 25, 20, 10 and so on.</p>
<h4 id="4-EXTRA-CREDIT-3"><a href="#4-EXTRA-CREDIT-3" class="headerlink" title="4.  EXTRA CREDIT"></a>4.  EXTRA CREDIT</h4><p>There is one more setting to consider when slowing a clip. (This does not apply when creating fast motion.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed012.jpg"
                      alt="speed012"
                ></p>
<p>Using, again, either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” menu, select Video Quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal. This is the best choice for speeds of 50% or faster.</li>
<li>Frame Blending. This is the best choice for speeds of about 20% to 50%.</li>
<li>Optical Flow. This is the best choice for speeds slower than about 20%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frame blending puts a short dissolve between frames when running in slow motion to improve the illusion of motion. Optical Flow invents in-between frames to minimize the jerkiness of extremely slow motion.</p>
<p>Frame blending is relatively fast and easy. Optical Flow will look better in most cases, but takes a long time to render.</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Save It with File Manager</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone’s storage.</p>
<p>Step 2: Open your <strong>File Manager app</strong>. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.</p>

<p> Step 3: On the next screen of Settings, you can enable the option of show hidden files. Go to the internal storage of the device.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Step 4: Look for the WhatsApp folder, go to ‘Media’ and then click on the folder ‘.Statuses’</p>

                      alt="file manager whatsapp statuses"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Save It with Third-Party App</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: First, download the app <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.downlood.sav.whmedia&hl=en_US&gl=US" >‘Status Saver – Downloader for WhatsApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.’ And open the app and grant it storage access.</p>
<p>Step 2: In order to save someone’s WhatsApp status, you must first view it in WhatsApp. After watching the status, open the Status Saver app.</p>
<p>Step 3: When you open it, you will see all the statuses you have seen on WhatsApp. Tap on the movie or image you wish to save, then click the download icon at the bottom. The share icon on the right allows you to share the status with WhatsApp contacts, Instagram, Facebook, and other networks.</p>

WhatsApp Status is activated only between two people, who have each other’s contact information saved in their address books; this happens by default.

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Save It with File Manager</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone’s storage.</p>

<p> Step 3: On the next screen of Settings, you can enable the option of show hidden files. Go to the internal storage of the device.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Step 4: Look for the WhatsApp folder, go to ‘Media’ and then click on the folder ‘.Statuses’</p>

                      alt="file manager whatsapp statuses"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>

<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>

                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="iphone app"
                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>
<h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity</h2><p> The new TiVo, the Roamio, has as many as six tuners that can record at the same time with up to 150 hours of high definition programming. You’ll never have another scheduling conflict again!</p>
<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>
<h2 id="5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface"><a href="#5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface" class="headerlink" title="5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface"></a>5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface</h2><p> The Comcast X1 DVR system has a voice-activated interface and a completely different look and layout than their standard system has.</p>

<p> The basic Comcast remote is a multi-function remote and capable of controlling all functions, but it does not have the ability to connect to a portable device like a tablet or a smartphone to have connectivity that way like a TiVo can through an app. The remote has to be line of sight in order to work.</p>

                ></p>
<p> The TiVo device menu is in standard definition, so for those who have a high definition set up, you may find this a bit distraction or fuzzy. It does come with apps for extending what the box can do, including games for kids.</p>
<p> Many reviewers liked the interface on the TiVo better than the grid used on the Comcast service. The TiVo programming guide allows you to delete channels you don’t watch so you’re only looking at the channels you like. Comcast’s guide covers every channel they offer, even ones that are not available on your tier of service.</p>

<p> TiVo’s device remote has a sleek layout called the “peanut”.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p> What it all comes down to is looking at how you use your TV, where you get your sources from, and what your budget is. Each device has its own set of things that are appealing, and its own drawbacks. For flexibility of being able to use multiple sources and devices, the TiVo is the clear winner. For cost in the long run, it’s almost a draw. For ease of connection to a TV, the Comcast box comes out on top. No matter which one you pick, you’ll never run out of great programs to watch.</p>

<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-2"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-2" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-2"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-2" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="comcast-menu"
                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-2"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-2" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="iphone app"
                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>
<h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-2"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-2" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity</h2><p> The new TiVo, the Roamio, has as many as six tuners that can record at the same time with up to 150 hours of high definition programming. You’ll never have another scheduling conflict again!</p>
<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>
<h2 id="5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface-2"><a href="#5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface-2" class="headerlink" title="5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface"></a>5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface</h2><p> The Comcast X1 DVR system has a voice-activated interface and a completely different look and layout than their standard system has.</p>

                ></p>
<p> The basic Comcast remote is a multi-function remote and capable of controlling all functions, but it does not have the ability to connect to a portable device like a tablet or a smartphone to have connectivity that way like a TiVo can through an app. The remote has to be line of sight in order to work.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="comcast remotes"
                ></p>
<p> The TiVo device menu is in standard definition, so for those who have a high definition set up, you may find this a bit distraction or fuzzy. It does come with apps for extending what the box can do, including games for kids.</p>
<p> Many reviewers liked the interface on the TiVo better than the grid used on the Comcast service. The TiVo programming guide allows you to delete channels you don’t watch so you’re only looking at the channels you like. Comcast’s guide covers every channel they offer, even ones that are not available on your tier of service.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tivo menu"
                ></p>
<p> With the TiVo Roamio, connecting to a tablet allows you to be in another room and still operate the “remote” for the TiVo DVR. Download the app onto your device and you’re ready to go.</p>
<p> TiVo’s device remote has a sleek layout called the “peanut”.</p>

<p> With the TiVo Roamio, connecting to a tablet allows you to be in another room and still operate the “remote” for the TiVo DVR. Download the app onto your device and you’re ready to go.</p>
<p> TiVo’s device remote has a sleek layout called the “peanut”.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p> What it all comes down to is looking at how you use your TV, where you get your sources from, and what your budget is. Each device has its own set of things that are appealing, and its own drawbacks. For flexibility of being able to use multiple sources and devices, the TiVo is the clear winner. For cost in the long run, it’s almost a draw. For ease of connection to a TV, the Comcast box comes out on top. No matter which one you pick, you’ll never run out of great programs to watch.</p>
