![video editor for sony camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movie-studio.jpg)

**Final tip**: Understand what you want and balance your needs against your budget and your interest in learning a new application, then you will be able to select the best software to edit videos shot on your Sony camcorder.

**●**   **Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos**

Vertical videos are beneficial even for the advertisers and promoters as they help them reach more audiences and prospective customers through social media sites and other sites.

## Part 2 How Vertical Videos Are Displayed

Vertical videos are majorly displayed on mobile devices as smartphones are used vertically most of the time.

## Part 3 What's the Best Tip to Resize social media Vertical Video Ratio?

![Avoid Side To Side Fast Movements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-5.jpg)

**●** Make use of text and graphics
