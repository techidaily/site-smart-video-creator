## Part 1 **What is aspect ratio?**

Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen's width will be almost twice as high as its height.

However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don't miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.

Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the**16\*9 aspect ratio calculator.**

Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.

Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.

Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.

## Part 2 **What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?**

The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9\. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.

You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.

The**16 \* 9 aspect ratio**calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.

## Part 3 **Top 16:9 resolutions**

These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.

**●** 15360×8640 (16K UHD)

**●** 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)

**●** 5120 × 2880 (5K)

**●** 3840 × 2160 (4K UHD)

**●** 3200 × 1800 (QHD+)

**●** 2560 × 1440 (QHD)

**●** 1920 × 1080 (Full HD)

**●** 1600 × 900 (HD+)

**●** 1366 × 768 (WXGA)

**●** 1280 × 720 (HD)

**●** 960 × 540 (qHD)

**●** 854 × 480 (FWVGA)

**●** 640 × 360 (nHD)

## Part 4 **How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?**

First, let's look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9\. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9\. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.

Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3\. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The**16\*9 ratio calculator**is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920/1080 equals 16:9.

First, here's the formula that we will use in this section.

Width (W) /Height (H) = 1.778

Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.

1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.

Example 1:

Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.

W/H = 16/9

32/H = 16/9

H =32 × 9/16

H = 18

Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.

Example 2

Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9\. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.

W/H = 19/6

W/720 = 19/6

W = 730 × 19/6

Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.

## Part 5 **How to use an aspect ratio calculator?**

These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 \*9 ratio calculator will give the **remaining distance.**

Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.

The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:

**Step 1:** Go to <https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/>

**Step 2:** Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.

## Part 1 **What is aspect ratio?**

Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen's width will be almost twice as high as its height.

However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don't miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.

Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the**16\*9 aspect ratio calculator.**

Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.

Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.

Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.

## Part 2 **What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?**

The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9\. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.

You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.

The**16 \* 9 aspect ratio**calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.

## Part 3 **Top 16:9 resolutions**

These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.

**●** 15360×8640 (16K UHD)

**●** 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)

**●** 5120 × 2880 (5K)

**●** 3840 × 2160 (4K UHD)

**●** 3200 × 1800 (QHD+)

**●** 2560 × 1440 (QHD)

**●** 1920 × 1080 (Full HD)

**●** 1600 × 900 (HD+)

**●** 1366 × 768 (WXGA)

**●** 1280 × 720 (HD)

**●** 960 × 540 (qHD)

**●** 854 × 480 (FWVGA)

**●** 640 × 360 (nHD)

## Part 4 **How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?**

First, let's look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9\. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9\. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.

Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3\. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The**16\*9 ratio calculator**is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920/1080 equals 16:9.

First, here's the formula that we will use in this section.

Width (W) /Height (H) = 1.778

Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.

1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.

Example 1:

Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.

W/H = 16/9

32/H = 16/9

H =32 × 9/16

H = 18

Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.

Example 2

Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9\. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.

W/H = 19/6

W/720 = 19/6

W = 730 × 19/6

Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.

## Part 5 **How to use an aspect ratio calculator?**

These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 \*9 ratio calculator will give the **remaining distance.**

## Part 3: How to Make Stop Motion Videos from Videos Online

In case you don’t have the photos you can use to create a stop motion animation, platforms like Kapwing allow you to turn a regular video into a stop motion video. All you need to do is upload a video clip from your computer or via a URL to Kapwing and the platform will automatically generate a stop motion video. One of the best part is that Kapwing also provides a sample if you don’t want to upload your own footage.

![    Import footage to Kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-stop-motion-footage-in-kapwing.jpg)

After the upload process is completed a new window will load where you can choose the speed at which frames are displayed on the screen and pick the rate at which frames are taken from the source video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker.jpg)

While adjusting these settings you should keep in mind that lowering a [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too much can result in choppy footage and uneven movement of the objects in the stop motion video you’re creating.

Kapwing also offers the option to [play the video in reverse](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but finding the right context to use this feature can prove to be a challenging task. Click on the Create button when ready to export the stop motion video and wait for the platform to generate the video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)

Afterward, you can choose to download, edit or share the video on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. In case you created a stop motion video while you were logged out of your Kapwing account, the platform will add a watermark to it, and you must sign in to [remove](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it.
