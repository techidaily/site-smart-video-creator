## Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?

If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one's website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.

These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.

Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.

* **To avoid file format hurdle**

To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.

Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.

* **Storage Space and File Size Limitations**

How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.

It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that's above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.

* **Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic**

According to [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/), there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it's viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.

How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.

* **Help Upload High-Quality Video**

Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.

To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.

Here are the best sites and their features;

## Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?

If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one's website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.

These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.

Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.

* **To avoid file format hurdle**

To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.

Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.

* **Storage Space and File Size Limitations**

How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.

It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that's above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.

* **Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic**

According to [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/), there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it's viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.

How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.

* **Help Upload High-Quality Video**

Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.

To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.

Here are the best sites and their features;

## Best Free Video Hosting Sites/Services/Platforms

File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.

Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.

The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans. They include the Pro at $19/Month and come with 20 embedded videos, Starter at $150/Month, Plus at $850/Month and Enterprise at an unspecified amount.

Vidyard offers unlimited bandwidth to its users across all the plans. Whether you are a private, a marketer, professional or an entrepreneur some features meet all your needs. Why is it loved by millions of users? The answer, the easy-to-use dashboard and plenty of features.

However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.

While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.

![video hosting platforms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dailymotion-interface.jpg)

With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren't as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn't limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.

However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers.

## How Filmora Video Editor Can Determine The Success of Your Videos?

As understood from the Anonymous video hosting sites and those made for privates and businesses, one important aspect is the money-making idea.

Every platform emphasizes the quality of a video. Other than how the message is conveyed, images, sounds, light contrasts, and background appearance determine over 75% of the video viewership.

To boost your video viewership before uploading to any video hosting service provider, I recommend the[**Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor.

Whether you want to change the video background colour, add video effects or add trending music, Filmora can really help.

If you are a beginner, don't worry. It's the simplest and easy-to-use video editing tool you'll find the internet. Secondly, there are free tutorials to learn from. Thirdly, the free plan is worth making your videos get thousands of views, shares, and comments in a day.

## Conclusion

I hope you read how the amazing list of video hosting sites above can be rewarding and can also make your fame like [MrBeast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA). Uploading good videos that are of high quality consistently is what determines the success of your hosted videos.

Using the little known free video hosting sites with insignificant traffic can be a waste of time and resources. Equally, choosing a site with complex entry requirements never yields meaningful results. Try all the above tried and tested sites before making an alternative choice.

The number of sites anyone can upload videos is huge. What other good free sites do you know? Leave your reply or comment below.

* Only videos with the same aspect ratio can be merged
* Poor quality on the output/resulting file, serious loss of quality from the sourcing files

In light of those above-mentioned reasons, it is wise for you to identify the following points before you move forward with your endeavor:

* The operation system of your computer, a Windows 7, or Windows8, Mac OS 10.10?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

### 01What Does OGG Means?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

### 03How to Play OGG Files?

Maybe the operating system at which you are using the device may support it but if it is not, look out for converter tools.

Different formats are available in which you can convert OGG like MP4, WEBM and AVI and so on. The reason behind doing the conversion is that devices do not allow users to play the content directly due to the lack of features in them.

# Best Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.

## Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

Even though selecting a video collage app isn’t a very complicated process, there are still a number of factors you need to consider before you choose to install a video collage app on your iPad or iPhone. Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.

#### 1. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-collage-maker/id543577420)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 8 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

As its name suggests, this app allows you to create both photo and video collages. You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.

#### 2. [PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picplaypost-video-editor/id498127541)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.3 or later

![PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor - Video Collage Making App ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99\.

#### 3. [PicStich](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pic-stitch-collage-editor/id454768104)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-stitch-collage-editor.jpg)

The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.

#### 4. [PhotoGrid - Pic Collage Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-pic-editor/id543577420)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photogrid-video-pic-editor.jpg)

If you are looking for an app that lets you create stunning video collages in seconds, you should look no further. PhotoGrid app lets you combine multiple videos within a single frame while offering a plethora of video editing tools you can use to enhance each video in the collage. What’s more, the app features a rich font library, stickers, filters and transitions you can use to make each video collage look more authentic. There are hundreds of available layouts to choose from that let you merge up to fifteen separate video clips and more than 400 backgrounds that can fit almost any style of a video collage. The app’s photo editing features are also remarkable which means that you can use the PhotoGrid app to manipulate images in any way you want.

#### 5. [PhotoVideo Collage Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photovideocollage-maker/id751270901?ls=1)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.2 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photovideocollage-maker.jpg)

Making a new video collage with PhotoVideo Collage Maker is a quick and simple process. You just have to pick a layout, arrange videos by dragging and dropping them to a preferred position and choose a frame for each video. The app features a rich collection frames and textures, and it even lets you use frames with curved edges that help your videos stand out. PhotoVideo Collage Maker enables you to import songs from your iTunes collection and allows you to control the volume of the videos or use the fade-in and fade-out effects. You can also choose if you want all the videos to play simultaneously or one after the other. Unlocking the app’s pro features will cost you $1.99, but making this investment is an excellent idea if you would like to use the PhotoVideo Collage Maker for professional purposes.

#### 6. [PicCollage Grid & Video Editor](https://apps.apple.com/bg/app/piccollage-grid-video-editor/id448639966)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.3 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PicCollage-grid-video-editor> .jpg)

iPhone and iPad owners in need of a video collage app that also offers powerful photo editing tools are going to love using the PicCollage Grid & Video Editor app. You can either use templates or create authentic grids on your own to impress your friends on social media. The app’s text editor lets change fonts, pick different text colors or change its alignment, while the cutout mode enables you to remove the background from your photos within seconds. Besides making video collages, you can also use the PicCollage Grid & Video Editor to create animated collages. The only downside is that all photo or video collages you create with the free version of the app are going to be watermarked.

#### 7. [VidStitch Frames for Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram/id712908978)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.0

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg)

VidsStitch was designed exclusively for iPhones and iPads, and it works best with the videos captured on these devices. The process of creating a new video collage can be completed in just a few quick steps. You should start by choosing one of the pre-designed frames, then you should just import and arrange your videos within the frame and decide whether you want to post the video collage on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. The free version of VidStich is going to watermark all your creations and it won’t allow you to add music to your collages, which is why purchasing the Pro pack and additional frames and borders will help you produce visual content that is going to impress your followers on social media.

**Conclusion**

Presentation of the videos you record with your iPhone or iPad is as important as their overall quality. The video collage makers for iOS-based devices provide you with all the tools you’re going to need to create visually dynamic, entertaining and attention-grabbing video collages your followers on social media are going to enjoy watching.

We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.

## Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

Even though selecting a video collage app isn’t a very complicated process, there are still a number of factors you need to consider before you choose to install a video collage app on your iPad or iPhone. Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.

#### 1. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-collage-maker/id543577420)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 8 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

As its name suggests, this app allows you to create both photo and video collages. You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.

#### 2. [PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picplaypost-video-editor/id498127541)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.3 or later

![PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor - Video Collage Making App ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99\.

#### 3. [PicStich](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pic-stitch-collage-editor/id454768104)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-stitch-collage-editor.jpg)

The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.

#### 4. [PhotoGrid - Pic Collage Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-pic-editor/id543577420)

If you are looking for an app that lets you create stunning video collages in seconds, you should look no further. PhotoGrid app lets you combine multiple videos within a single frame while offering a plethora of video editing tools you can use to enhance each video in the collage. What’s more, the app features a rich font library, stickers, filters and transitions you can use to make each video collage look more authentic. There are hundreds of available layouts to choose from that let you merge up to fifteen separate video clips and more than 400 backgrounds that can fit almost any style of a video collage. The app’s photo editing features are also remarkable which means that you can use the PhotoGrid app to manipulate images in any way you want.

#### 5. [PhotoVideo Collage Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photovideocollage-maker/id751270901?ls=1)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.2 or later

PhotoVideo Collage Maker enables you to import songs from your iTunes collection and allows you to control the volume of the videos or use the fade-in and fade-out effects. You can also choose if you want all the videos to play simultaneously or one after the other. Unlocking the app’s pro features will cost you $1.99, but making this investment is an excellent idea if you would like to use the PhotoVideo Collage Maker for professional purposes.

Besides making video collages, you can also use the PicCollage Grid & Video Editor to create animated collages. The only downside is that all photo or video collages you create with the free version of the app are going to be watermarked.

#### 7. [VidStitch Frames for Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram/id712908978)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.0

The free version of VidStich is going to watermark all your creations and it won’t allow you to add music to your collages, which is why purchasing the Pro pack and additional frames and borders will help you produce visual content that is going to impress your followers on social media.

**Conclusion**
