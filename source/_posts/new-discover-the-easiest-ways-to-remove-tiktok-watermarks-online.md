## FCP X Effects Made Simple: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

# Simple Guide to FCP X: How To Add Effects in 3 Steps

There are two broad categories of effects in Final Cut Pro X: Inspector effects and Effects Browser effects.

I've written previously about how to use Inspector effects to create a [picture-in-picture](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effect, among many other effects available to us in Final Cut Pro. In this article, I want to show you how to apply an effect to a clip, modify that effect, temporarily turn that effect on or off, or delete it entirely.

---

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Apply Effects to Video in Final Cut Pro X

* [Modify an effect](#part2)
* [Disable and delete an effect](#part3)

#### Find and apply an effect

Here is our clip - a fearsome polar bear.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx001.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To apply an effect, first select the clip in the Timeline.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx002.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Then, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Effects Browser (or type Cmd + 5).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx003.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The Browser, like all the effects browsers, lists categories of effects on the left, a search box at the bottom to use for searching for the names of effects, and effects for each category on the right.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx004.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Here, for example, I've selected the Blur category, with my cursor near the Gaussian blur effect. (Gaussian blur is the best effect to use when you want a clip to look blurry.)

To apply an effect, do one of two things:

* Drag the effect from the Browser onto the clip you want to change.
* If the clip, or clips, are selected, double-click the effect in the Browser to apply it.

#### Modify an effect

To modify an effect, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Inspector (or type Cmd + 4).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx005.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Click the Video tab in the Inspector. Effects from the Effects Browser are always listed at the top of the Inspector.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx006.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Grab a slider and drag it to see what happens. For example, to make an image blurrier, drag the Amount slider to the right. To lessen the effect, drag it to the left.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx007.jpg "add effects in fcp")

#### Disable and delete an effect

To temporarily disable an effect, without deleting it, click the blue box so that it turns gray.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx008.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To enable an effect, click the gray box so it turns blue again.

To delete an effect, click the name of the effect - in this example: Gaussian - and press the big Delete key.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx009.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The effect will be deleted from the selected clip.

#### Extra credit

You can apply, modify, even delete the same effect to multiple clips by first selecting all the clips you want to change in the Timeline then adding, changing the settings, or deleting an effect in the Inspector.

#### Summary

The process of applying effects is the same for all effects you apply from the Effects Browser. In future articles I'll show you how to use this technique to create a wide variety of different effects in Final Cut Pro X.

## Unleash Fast-Paced Edits with Motion Blur in Final Cut Pro X

##### Wondershare Filmora

Create stunning effects with simple clicks.

Motion blur is the visual smearing or streaking caught on camera from the subject's movement, camera, or both. The human eye notices motion blur in real life naturally. So, a subtle blur in movies and videos makes them look more reality based.

Final Cut Pro does not have a built-in Motion Blur Effect. But there are several software and websites that allow you to add a blur effect. You need to buy the plugins and templates that will help you create this effect. In this article, we have talked about how to add the Motion Blur Effect to Final Cut Pro with the help of different templates. Without further ado, let's hop into it!

#### In this article

01 [How to Add Motion Blur in FCPX?](#part1)

02 [How to Do Motion Blur in Easy Way?](#part2)

03 [Motion Blur Plugins or Templates for FCPX \[Free＆Paid\]](#part3)

04 [Motion Blur Effect in Filmmaking](#part4)

## Part1: How to Add Motion Blur in FCPX?

Usually most people would use several software and websites to add Motion Blur, but there's also a way to add the blur effect in FCPX. Follow the steps below to add motion blur in FCPX.

##### Step1Add an Adjustment Layer

Select Title from the above menu, a drop-down with several options will appear. Find the one with the adjustment layer's name and click on it. Drag the Adjustment Layer to timeline and expand it to the whole length or the specific part of the video. Adjust the settings from the menu at the left of the view.

**Note:** You must download the adjustment layer first. Generally, you will find the recently added adjustment layer in the Custom option.

![Add_an_Adjustment_Layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Add_an_Adjustment_Layer.jpg)

##### Step2Apply Transformation Effect

Select **Transformation** from the bottom left of the view, a drop-down menu will appear. Now, select **Transform** from it. You will see a white with several blue dots surrounding the view. You can use these blue dots to **Flip, Rotate,** and **Adjust the position** of the view screen.

![Apply_Transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Apply_Transition.jpg)

##### Step3Apply Keyframing and Motion Blur

While you are in the Transformation window, you will see a menu on the right of your view. From that menu, you can apply keyframing by adjusting **Position, Rotate,** and **Scale** under the **Transform** tab.

**Note:** Select the part of the video you want to apply keyframing on first.

Select the Title option from the above menu. Another menu will appear; select Motion Blur from it and apply the motion blur on video by dragging the effect to the timeline. To smooth it out, select Modify from the top and pick Random Selection from it.

![motion_blur_and_modify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/motion_blur_and_modify.jpg)

Speed up your video first by selecting the third option from the left bottom of the view. A drop-down menu will appear; choose Reset Speed. A Green bar will appear on the top of the timeline; click on it and select Fast to speed up the video. Moreover, you will have to download the Motion Blur plugin.

## Part2: How to Do Motion Blur in Easy Way?

The motion needs a sufficient amount of blur. It happens with our natural perception as well. For example, if something moves too quickly, it appears blur to our eyes. So, it must be the right amount of blur.

To tackle this problem, we add motion blur to make it look more natural and reality based. It provides the natural smearing we see when something moves too quickly but not when shooting the video. To add this effect, you can use powerful editing software such as Wondershare Filmora. Follow the below steps to add a blur effect to your video on Filmora.

## Part4: Motion Blur Effect in Filmmaking

Motion Blur is one of the essential effects to add when you are making a movie. It exaggerates the motion in a perfect way which is necessary for most action movies. This blur effect is usually the result of something moving quicker than the camera. The more significant the speed difference between the camera filming and the moving object, the more pronounced motion blur will be.

In the majority of the cases, it is best to apply motion blur on background objects than the subjects. For example, motion blur is perfect for the shots in which the camera moves at the same speed as the subject. Although, if the subject is moving faster than the camera, you would want a minimal blur.

Technically speaking, more excellent motion blur can be obtained through a lower shutter speed or vice versa. Ensure that your shutter speed is always twice your framerate because anything lower can result in unnatural-looking footage. The famous bike chase of Star Wars Episode VI is a perfect example of the productive application of motion blur. The scene was captured by walking in the forest and shooting a single frame per time.

## Conclusion

Most of the videos need a significant amount of blur to make them look realistic. FCPX is excellent editing software, but it does not have blurring effects. However, there's a way to add blur effect in FCPX, but many people are unaware of it.

To tackle this problem, we came up with different plugins for Motion Blur and its effects in filmmaking. So, now you have in-depth knowledge of how you can add blur effects in FCPX.

## Part2: How to Do Motion Blur in Easy Way?

The motion needs a sufficient amount of blur. It happens with our natural perception as well. For example, if something moves too quickly, it appears blur to our eyes. So, it must be the right amount of blur.

To tackle this problem, we add motion blur to make it look more natural and reality based. It provides the natural smearing we see when something moves too quickly but not when shooting the video. To add this effect, you can use powerful editing software such as Wondershare Filmora. Follow the below steps to add a blur effect to your video on Filmora.

## Part4: Motion Blur Effect in Filmmaking

Motion Blur is one of the essential effects to add when you are making a movie. It exaggerates the motion in a perfect way which is necessary for most action movies. This blur effect is usually the result of something moving quicker than the camera. The more significant the speed difference between the camera filming and the moving object, the more pronounced motion blur will be.

In the majority of the cases, it is best to apply motion blur on background objects than the subjects. For example, motion blur is perfect for the shots in which the camera moves at the same speed as the subject. Although, if the subject is moving faster than the camera, you would want a minimal blur.

Technically speaking, more excellent motion blur can be obtained through a lower shutter speed or vice versa. Ensure that your shutter speed is always twice your framerate because anything lower can result in unnatural-looking footage. The famous bike chase of Star Wars Episode VI is a perfect example of the productive application of motion blur. The scene was captured by walking in the forest and shooting a single frame per time.

## Conclusion

Most of the videos need a significant amount of blur to make them look realistic. FCPX is excellent editing software, but it does not have blurring effects. However, there's a way to add blur effect in FCPX, but many people are unaware of it.

To tackle this problem, we came up with different plugins for Motion Blur and its effects in filmmaking. So, now you have in-depth knowledge of how you can add blur effects in FCPX.
