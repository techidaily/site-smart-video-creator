 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Back in 1999, Apple launched Final Cut Pro, and the software didn't take so long to become the first choice for video editors and post-production agencies.

The main feature it has that makes it stands out from any other video-editing software out there is that it is made exclusively to operate on Mac only, and that allowed Apple to make it fully enhanced for speed and efficiency enabling it to [**edit 4K**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) **UHD footage** with no rendering issues.

This video editing software will cost you $300 to buy, and as mentioned above it will require you to have a Mac OS, so if you don't have both or if you are a [beginner in video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) we are suggesting a few alternatives for you that you might choose one from to start your video editing journey.

## Best Free & Paid Final Cut Pro X Alternatives on Windows/ Mac/ Linux

### 4. Video Toolbox

Video Toolbox is a [free online video editing tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that has a rich set of video functions. But like many online apps, it imposes a size restriction of 300 MB for your video files. To use it, you have to register first and upload the target files either from the hard disk or online video sites. Then fish the merging task use the command from a drop-down.

### 6. Movica

This software is, in essence, a user interface for other open-source tools that are somewhat user-unfriendly, enabling an understandable user interface for the best free tools out there. As a software package though, there is nothing wrong with this approach, and the tools available for joining and merging are first-rate, and the software works very fast, whilst offering a wide range of compatible video formats.

The interface is a little clunky, but it does the job and the software has additional tools for other editing work such as cutting and trimming as well, the added functionality in combination with a more basic interface can make some operations a touch confusing though.

![Movica](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/movica.jpg)

Ultimately a little more complicated to use, but very good.

### 7. Cyberlink PowerDirector 365

PowerDirector 365 is a professional video editor in the Cyberlink family. It is a great [Final Cut Pro alternative on Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Users can use multiple cameras to make various green-screen effects and make split-screen effects. What's more, you can control frame-by-frame with its motion tracking. It also supports using plug-ins ranging from animated titles to travel packs. The official recommendation of the operating system is Windows 10/8/7\. It works best on 64 bit.

**Pros:**
