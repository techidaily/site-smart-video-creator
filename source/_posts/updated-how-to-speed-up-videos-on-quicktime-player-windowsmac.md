FAQs about Vlogging Apps

1. **What is the best app for vlogging?**

There are many video editing apps that you can use on both a mobile device or a desktop computer. If you’re editing vlog videos on iPhone, you can use the free built-in iMovie. If you are using Android to vlog, you can try Filmora. For vloggers who prefer to edit videos on a Windows or Mac computer, I recommend Filmora because of the resources and effects.

1. **Can I vlog with my phone?**

Yes, of course, you can vlog with your iPhone or Android phone. In recent days, most phones are equipped with a high-quality camera, and with the help of some camera shoot apps and video editing apps, you can totally record, edit and upload vlog videos on your phone.

1. **Which video editing software do vloggers use?**

There is no best for all. For vloggers in different stages, I recommend different editing software. For beginners who did not have any editing experience, I recommend you to try the pre-programmed video editing apps, such as Windows 10 Photos or iMovie. For those who are looking for a more powerful editor, I recommend Filmora because of its editing tools and plentiful effects and resources.
