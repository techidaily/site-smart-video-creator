Once in the timeline, clips can be duplicated, trimmed or split, and any of the split sections deleted.

For advanced users, you can also achieve **picture-in-picture** (image/video overlay) tracks and customize with motion, effects and mask. Very charming features to take your movie to the next level instantly.
