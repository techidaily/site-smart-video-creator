For macOS 10.12 or later

Filmora video editor allows you to adjust the brightness with the auto enhance feature in one-click. Whatâ€™s more, it provides the color match feature which allows you to match the color between different clips.

### **2\.** VSDC Free Video Editor

The VSDC Free Footage Editor, in the hands of a skilled user, can generate some truly professional-looking videos. The application supports virtually all major video formats and includes complex video effects such as object transformation and color correction, and also advanced audio effects such as volume adjustment and sound normalization. You have the luxury of brightening your videos simply by uploading the video from your desktop and making whatever changes that you want to make.

VSDC Free Video Editor is actually free, unlike certain "high-end" editors. You may utilize the whole feature set of the application without having to contend with annoying watermarks. Unfortunately, there is one snag. You must pay if you want technical assistance. (And there's a strong possibility you'll have to.) Subscription for the VSDC Free Video Editor is $1 per month, $5 per half-year, and $10 per year.

### **3\.** iMovie

iMovie for Mac allows you to experience your films in new ways. Make Hollywood-style teasers and gorgeous movies in excellent 4K resolution by quickly browsing your footage and instantly sharing your best moments. Color Balance and Color Correction are two options for brightening a movie in iMovie 10.1 or later. The former has four tabs: Auto, Match Color, White Balance, and Skin Tone Balance, which allow you to make automated color adjustments.

The latter has sliders for manually adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, shadows, and other parameters. Simply choose the clip you want to change and then select the appropriate tool from the toolbar above the viewer. It's not very technical, but it makes it simple to brighten up a gloomy video.

### 4\. **Premiere** Pro CC

Premiere Pro includes a user interface that is both appealing and versatile. The startup feature enables you to rapidly return to previous projects, start new ones, or browse for Adobe Stock video. You can switch between workspaces for Assembly, Editing, Color, Effects, Audio, and Titles, and the dark system window tends to make your videos the focus of attention.

Premiere Pro CC is another desktop video editor that you can use to brighten your videos. The various parameters in the Lumetri Color panel window inside Premiere Pro CC may be used to accomplish video color correction.

Premiere Pro's Lumetri Color Tools elevate the application to the level of Photoshop for video. These tools provide a surprising amount of color modification and a wide range of film and HDR effects. With keyframes, you may modify the white balance, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and black point, among other things. Modifications for Saturation, Vibrance, Faded Film and Sharpen are also accessible.

### 5\. Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro comes with a set of robust manual color correction features that can be used to achieve a wide range of color correction and enhancement features. Creating a color correction effect and then modifying the effect's settings in the Color inspector is how you utilize the tools. Any of the following color correction effects may be used to make manual color modifications to the color tint, brightness, and contrast of the entire clip picture.

Color correction capabilities in Final Cut Pro allow you to fine-tune the look of any video in your project, including still photos, by adjusting color balance, shadow levels, mid-tone thresholds, highlight levels, and much more. Saturation, exposure, and color modifications are all controlled via the Color Board. Adjust the Brightness in the color adjustment panels to brighten your movies.

**Conclusion**

Adjusting brightness has become a "small problem" for many. Oftentimes, you record a video, and it falls short of the brightness criteria â€“ it's too dark! However, when you have quality **Video Brightness Editors**, like the ones we have reviewed above, you're in good hands. Not only are these apps easy to use with excellent functionality, but they also make editing a piece of cake for everyone.

## Part 1: Top 5 Best Free 4K Video Editing Software for Windows and Mac

### 1. iMovie

**Supported OS:** iPhone, iPad, and Mac

[iMovie](https://www.apple/imovie/) is one of the most popular free 4K Video editing software. Using iMovie, you can create a professional-looking video even without any editing experience.

Irrespective of the kind of device youâ€™re using to edit your videos, you need to pay attention to some features your device must have. However, these requirements depend on the 4K video editing software free.

* **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** The Processor of the software being used must be Intel Core i7, 2.3Ghz four-core; this is applicable if you will be editing your videos offline. Then, Dual Intel Xeon 2Ghz six-core is applicable if you will be editing your videos online.
* **Random Access Memory (RAM):** Preferably an 8GB Memory if youâ€™re editing offline, and 32GB Memory if youâ€™re editing online.
* **Internal storage:** The required storage must be sufficient because 4K videos are huge files.

Note: Offline editing refers to editing a [proxy file of the original source material](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/); online editing is the editing of the original material.

## Part 3: Tips for Editing 4K Videos Smoothly

* **Choose the software based on your hardware:** To choose the best 4K video editing software free, you must not opt for an editing software with higher requirements than your hardware; such software wonâ€™t work well on your device. You should instead select an editing software with lower requirements.
* [**Split large 4K videos into several parts**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/): It has been reiterated that 4K videos are huge files; to edit your videos smoothly, it is recommended to split up the videos and edit one after the other. This will save you from heavy data loss.
* **Enable graphics accelerator**: A graphic accelerator is used in video editing to turbocharge your video exporting. Itâ€™s usually clung to a video board of your system. It makes the editing easier and faster by preventing a heavy workload.
