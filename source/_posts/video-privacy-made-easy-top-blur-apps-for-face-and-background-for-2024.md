## Best Online Video Collage Makers \[Free & Paid\]

Platforms that exclusively offer **video collage-making** services are rare, and in most cases, you have to use a [web-based video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to create video collages online.

In addition, the video editing platforms that do provide the video collage feature, offer only a limited amount of video editing tools, which is the reason why it is still better to use [video editing software for PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or Mac computers if you want to make video collages professionally. However, there are still a few online destinations where you can combine several videos with ease.

#### 1. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/collage)

You can then **enhance the colors** in each video separately, use the **Bring Forward and Send Backward** options or fine-tune the playback speed of the videos in your collage. However, all video collages created with the free version of the platform are going to be watermarked and you must **subscribe to the Pro version** of Kapwing if you want to make watermark-free video collages.

#### 2. [Animoto](https://animoto.com/)

**Price:** Free trial available, pricing plans start at $15 per month

![Animoto Make Video Collage ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animoto-video-collage-layout.jpg)

The huge selection of fully customizable templates Animoto offers enable you to create videos for a broad range of purposes.

Animoto also lets you **add text, photo, video or collage blocks** in case the template you’ve selected doesn’t contain all the elements you want to feature in a video. So if you want to create video collages with Animoto you simply have to **add as many collage blocks as you want** and then import the footage you’d like to include in a video collage.

However, **you can only use photos to create video collages**, which limits your options significantly. The process of making a new video collage is easy, as you just have to **pick one of the available templates** and proceed to **upload the images** you’d like to include in the collage you’re making.
