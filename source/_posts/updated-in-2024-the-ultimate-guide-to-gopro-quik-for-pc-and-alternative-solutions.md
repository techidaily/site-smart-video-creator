## **GoPro Quik PC- An Overview**

Do you need an app for editing GoPro videos and photos? If the answer is yes, then you should go for GoPro Quik for Desktop. GoPro Quik is a video editing software that allows you to edit your GoPro videos and photos within no time. The app comes with a very simple user interface that will help you quickly edit your videos. GoPro Quik for desktop was created to meet your basic needs and wants when it comes to editing GoPro photos and videos. You can easily edit your GoPro photos and videos using this app. This app will help you in creating post-production videos like a pro.

The best thing about GoPro Quick for Desktop is that it is free to use and is available easily for both 32 bit and 64 bit systems. It also has a simple and intuitive interface that anyone can adopt, even if you don't have any prior experience with this video editing app. It basically allows you to import your GoPro clips, highlight your favorite clips, and then it edits your video for you–including adding music. The process is pretty quick, as the name suggests.

## **GoPro Quik Windows Features**

GoPro Quik app is rich with features, and it provides pretty much everything that you need to create amazing photos and videos. A few highlighting features are discussed below:

### 1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks

With GoPro Quik, making amazing videos is very easy. With just a few clicks, you can import all your videos and photos. Then you can edit them in just a few clicks. Everything here is so simple that you will feel like a pro video editor yourself.

### 2.Auto Cloud Uploads

Another amazing feature of GoPro Quik is that once you have done editing your videos, they will be automatically uploaded to your cloud. But for this feature to work, make sure that you have an active GoPro PLUS subscription.

### 3.Excellent editing

Simply click a few buttons to turn GoPro footage into an awesome video. Pick the perfect soundtrack, then pick your favorite moments. Your video automatically syncs with the music, so you can share it in just a few seconds. Make your videos come alive with panning effects by adding photos and time-lapse sequences.

### 4.Share with friends

Make short videos that are ideal for posting on Facebook, YouTube, and more. Make a unique video from your burst and timelapse photos. Additionally, you can find and save the most memorable moments in a video, then share them as high-quality still images.

### 5.New Speed Tool

Tap the pencil to choose the Speed icon for the video in your Media Mural. Then you can apply more than one-speed effect simultaneously. The speed can be toggled between real-time and half-speed slow motion. You can also add freeze frames for a specified period of time.

### 6.GoPro-Exclusive filters

From Media or Mural, select a photo or video and tap the pencil. In order to optimize the footage to the environment it was shot in, GoPro has created 25 filters in-house. By using the scrub bar, you can adjust the intensity of each filter.

### 7.Premium Themes

Alternatively, you may create a new highlight from Media. You will be presented with 13 video editing themes. Besides adding text and transitions, you can also change the music, choose the duration, and choose the right format for your intended sharing platform, such as social media or text.

##### Pros

Despite its ease and quickness, there are a few drawbacks to it. First, I must say this is awesome and perfect for anyone who has never edited a GoPro video before. When you're new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it's great for those who aren't familiar with it. It's all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That's it.

##### Cons

You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!

In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library. Users cannot import their own music either.

Additionally, you may only create a certain number of Highlights. Each 30-second video is limited to 10 Highlights.

## Final Verdict

Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor.

Filmora comes with plenty of features and can easily compete with the most advanced video editors in the world. The best thing is, you can download and install it for free and try all of its features without paying a penny. Also, there is an amazing community and Filmora support that you won’t find anywhere else.

Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don't support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren't designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.

These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let's see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.

## Part 1: How to Run Windows and Mac OS Video Editing Apps on Chromebook

As we already mentioned there are two different ways to run Mac and Windows OS video editing apps from your Chromebook, although one method is much less complicated than the other. Let's have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.

#### Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote

A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.

#### 1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote

The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app's main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.

![chromebook-remote-desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-remote-desktop.jpg)

Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you've completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.

#### 2.Choose PIN

In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn't go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.

![chromebook-pin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-pin.jpg)

#### 3.Make Connection

In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you'd like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.

![chromebook-connection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-connection.jpg)

#### 4.Optimize Options

Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you'd like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who'd like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn't offer a direct transfer of files as an option.

#### Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine

The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can't run on ARM powered Chromebooks.

* The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.
* The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.

![chromebook-virtual-machine](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-virtual-machine.jpg)

* After you've successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you'd like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.

Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.

Bonus: We highly recommend you to use our Filmora X following the instructions above, we optimized the app for it.

* The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.

* After you've successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you'd like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.

Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.

Bonus: We highly recommend you to use our Filmora X following the instructions above, we optimized the app for it.

Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don't support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren't designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.

These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let's see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.

## Part 1: How to Run Windows and Mac OS Video Editing Apps on Chromebook

As we already mentioned there are two different ways to run Mac and Windows OS video editing apps from your Chromebook, although one method is much less complicated than the other. Let's have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.

#### Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote

A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.

#### 1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote

The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app's main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.

![chromebook-remote-desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-remote-desktop.jpg)

Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you've completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.

#### 2.Choose PIN

In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn't go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.

![chromebook-pin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-pin.jpg)

#### 3.Make Connection

In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you'd like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.

![chromebook-connection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-connection.jpg)

#### 4.Optimize Options

Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you'd like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who'd like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn't offer a direct transfer of files as an option.

#### Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine

The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can't run on ARM powered Chromebooks.

* The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.
