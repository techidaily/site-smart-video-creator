_“How good is CyberLink PowerDirector when it comes to automatic color matching?”_

CyberLink is one of the best video editors with features including motion tracking, screen recording, Multicam editing, etc. It further consists of tools such as titles, transitions, and effects to use quickly. However, we need to talk here about the **PowerDirector color match** process and assess its easiness. No matter how good a video editor is, the process must be simple to understand for the primary users. So, let’s begin with the step-by-step guide on how to color match different video clips in PowerDirector.

The Color Match feature of CyberLink PowerDirector allows matching tones and colors on selected video clips.

## Part 1: How to Color Match Different Video Clips in PowerDirector?

Applying color match/color correction to different clips at the same time also speeds up your workflow.

**Step 1: Download ColorDirector**

The first step to effectively do color matching in CyberLink PowerDirector is to download the ColorDirector. It contains a real camera and color effects to achieve cinematic color match editing.

**Step 2: Apply Presets to multiple clips on singletrack**

We assume that you already have clips imported into the timeline. Thus, do a left-click on the first clip, select **Fix/Enhance** tab, and then choose **ColorDirector** in the preview window.

**Step 3: Make manual adjustments**

Yes, you are required to make manual adjustments by clicking the **Manual** and **Adjustments** tab in the preview window.

You can now make some adjustments to **RGB Channel**, as here we have made it a little darker.

After you’re over with the manual adjustment, click **Back** to go back to the PowerDirector. Now, you can see that an adjustment is made to the selected clip.

Then, you need to click **Apply to All** and see the effect getting added to all the clips on the same track.

**Step 4: Apply color match adjustments at different tracks**

Again, apply the same process by left-clicking the video clip on a different track. Select **Fix/Enhance** and then go to **Color Director**.

Now, make some adjustments to the **RBG Channel** as we have made it a little brighter here. Then, you need to save this adjustment as Preset to apply to multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks. Hit the **Create** \> **Preset** tab as shown in the image below.

Then, you can name the **Preset** and hit on **Save** tab.

After you go back to the PowerDirector, you can see your recently-saved preset in the **Presets** list.

Now, select multiple clips. Left-click on a clip, hold the **Ctrl** key, then left-click on another clip while holding the **Ctrl** key, and so on. You will be able to choose more than one clip in this manner.

Then, check the **Color Presets/CLUTs** tab and select the **Preset** that you have saved to apply on multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks.

So, these were the steps of **PowerDirector color match** manual adjustments. We have only adjusted **RGB Channel**, but there are many others to look for and consider.

## Part 2: An Easier Solution to Automatically Matching the Color of Video Footage

Got confused by manual adjustments? There is an alternative solution if you also hate the manual process of color adjustments in CyberLink PowerDirector. Go no far than the professional yet beginner-friendly [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to check in for automatic color match adjustments. Yes, you don't have to go for separate adjustments in RGB Channel, etc., as you have done before.

The Wondershare Filmora is also one of the most considerable video editors in the professional industry. It comes with pretty intuitive advanced editing tools such as **Video Stabilization**, **Color Tuning**, **Color Matching**, **Green Screen**, **Key** **Framing**, and **Motion Tracking,** etc., to name a few.

Without further ado, let’s note down the automatic color match process in Wondershare Filmora as follows.

### Steps for Automatic Color Matching Different Video Clips in Wondershare Filmora

**Step 1: Download Wondershare Filmora**

Firstly, tap the **Try It Free** button to download Wondershare Filmora and proceed with the installation.

**Step 2: Import media files**

Then, import media files. We have imported two stock footage with different color schemes, as shown below.

**Step 3: Apply Color Match**

Double-click the footage over the timeline and head to the **Color** panel, as shown in the screenshot below. Then, select the **Color Match** option.

Turn on the **Comparison View** and move the slider given in the preview section. To match color settings, click on **Match** and wait a few seconds to let it see the same in both the **Reference** and **Current** preview window.

So, this is all you need to do as an alternative for the **PowerDirector color match**. The color match settings in Wondershare Filmora are relatively automatic and do not require additional RGB Channels adjustments.

## Conclusion

After discussing the steps on the **PowerDirector color match** process, we’d now like to mention our final words. To find the easy, effective, and time-saving method, you should first consider the length of steps above in both sections. After the small analysis, you can check up on your favorite way of color matching.

## Cropping Images in FCPX: Tips, Tricks, and Best Practices

# Final Cut Pro X: How to Crop an Image

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Cropping an image means to remove a portion of the image, either to hide something you don't want the audience to see or emphasize different elements within the image. Just as Photoshop allows us to crop still images, Final Cut Pro X allows us to crop moving video clips, as you'll learn in this article.

---

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## How to Crop an Image in Final Cut Pro X

However, before I show how this is done, I need to explain one really important fact about video: all video uses what's called "fixed resolution." Fixed resolution means that high-definition video is always displayed at one of two sizes:

**You May Also Like:** [How to Crop GIF Images >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* 1920 x 1080 pixels
* 1920 x 1080 pixels

Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don't like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.

I'll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called "trimming") and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called "cropping"). You get to pick which one works the best for you.

#### TRIMMING

Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop001.jpg)

For instance, here an image - courtesy of Pond5 (<www.pond5.com>). Let's say that we want to emphasize the barn and not the sky.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop002.jpg)

The easiest way to do this is to click the icon in the lower left corner of the Viewer and choose "Crop."

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop003.jpg)

This displays the cropping tools in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop004.jpg)

Click the Trim button to turn on Trim mode. (This article discusses Trim and Crop. I'll cover the Ken Burns effect in a future article.)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop005.jpg)

Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.

NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop006.jpg)

Drag other corners or edges to further trim the image.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop007.jpg)

When you have trimmed the image the way you want, click the "Done" button in the top right corner to exit trimming mode.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop008.jpg)

If no other clip is below the trimmed clip, the background will be black.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop009.jpg)

But, it actually isn't black, it's transparent. If you put another clip below it, you'll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.

Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.

#### CROPPING

Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.

There are several ways we can choose to crop an image:

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop010.jpg)

* Click the Crop icon, as we illustrated above

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop011.jpg)

* Right-mouse click (or Control-click) inside the Viewer and choose
* Type Shift+C

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop012.jpg)

\* In the Inspector > Video tab > Crop (this option provides the most precision, but is the least intuitive to use)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop013.jpg)

If you selected any option except the Inspector, click the Crop button in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop014.jpg)

Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.

Final Cut displays numbers at the top of the Viewer indicating how much the image has been cropped.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop015.jpg)

Reposition the frame by grabbing inside the rectangle and dragging.

When you are happy with the results, click the Done button in the top right corner.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop017.jpg)

Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don't see it.

And, if you look closely, you'll see that the cropped image is softer (blurrier) than the original and edges are more likely to be stair-stepped.

#### RESET

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop018.jpg)

To reset a cropped image back to its default settings, open the Inspector and click the small curved arrow to the right of the word "Crop."

#### SUMMARY

Trimming is used to hide portions of an image and superimpose it over another image.

Cropping is used to reframe an image, say from a medium shot to a close-up, but runs the risk of overly softening an image. The general rule is that cropping a little is OK, but don't crop too much.

I use both these techniques frequently in my own editing.

Cropping an image means to remove a portion of the image, either to hide something you don't want the audience to see or emphasize different elements within the image. Just as Photoshop allows us to crop still images, Final Cut Pro X allows us to crop moving video clips, as you'll learn in this article.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## How to Crop an Image in Final Cut Pro X

However, before I show how this is done, I need to explain one really important fact about video: all video uses what's called "fixed resolution." Fixed resolution means that high-definition video is always displayed at one of two sizes:

**You May Also Like:** [How to Crop GIF Images >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* 1920 x 1080 pixels
* 1920 x 1080 pixels

Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don't like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.

I'll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called "trimming") and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called "cropping"). You get to pick which one works the best for you.

#### TRIMMING

Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop001.jpg)

For instance, here an image - courtesy of Pond5 (<www.pond5.com>). Let's say that we want to emphasize the barn and not the sky.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop002.jpg)

The easiest way to do this is to click the icon in the lower left corner of the Viewer and choose "Crop."

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop003.jpg)

This displays the cropping tools in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop004.jpg)

Click the Trim button to turn on Trim mode. (This article discusses Trim and Crop. I'll cover the Ken Burns effect in a future article.)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop005.jpg)

Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.

NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop006.jpg)

Drag other corners or edges to further trim the image.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop007.jpg)

When you have trimmed the image the way you want, click the "Done" button in the top right corner to exit trimming mode.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop008.jpg)

If no other clip is below the trimmed clip, the background will be black.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop009.jpg)

But, it actually isn't black, it's transparent. If you put another clip below it, you'll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.

Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.

#### CROPPING

Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.

There are several ways we can choose to crop an image:

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop010.jpg)

* Click the Crop icon, as we illustrated above

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop011.jpg)

* Right-mouse click (or Control-click) inside the Viewer and choose
* Type Shift+C

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop012.jpg)

\* In the Inspector > Video tab > Crop (this option provides the most precision, but is the least intuitive to use)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop013.jpg)

If you selected any option except the Inspector, click the Crop button in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop014.jpg)

Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.

Final Cut displays numbers at the top of the Viewer indicating how much the image has been cropped.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop015.jpg)

Reposition the frame by grabbing inside the rectangle and dragging.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop016.jpg)

When you are happy with the results, click the Done button in the top right corner.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop017.jpg)

Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don't see it.

And, if you look closely, you'll see that the cropped image is softer (blurrier) than the original and edges are more likely to be stair-stepped.

# Top 10 Best GIF Speed Changers

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.

But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.

## Part 1: Best GIF Speed Changer Software: Wondershare Filmora

If you are looking for a gif editor that empowers you to create gifs better, you should try some desktop tools. Here I recommend you using Filmora to change gif speed and edit further.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an easy-to-use video editor for all creators. With its user-friendly interface, a wide range of editing tools, and tons of video effects, you can create videos and change the speed of gifs easily.

#### How To Change GIF Speed In Filmora Video Editor?

Below is a brief step by step tutorial about changing the speed of gif with Filmora. Click to get more details about [how to convert and edit gifs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with Filmora.

1. With your gifs open on the screen, right click and select **Speed** **and Duration** .
2. In the Custom Speed window, you will see a speed slider locates at the middle, which indicates the default 1.x speed. And the Duration option suggests the duration of the gif.
3. To change the speed of gif, you can drag the speed slider forward or backward to speed up or slow down the playback. Or, you can just enter the number to a specific duration.
4. With such an easy process for changing the GIF speed, users will find they can adjust the clip to their hearts content, until they achieve the perfect finish.

![change gif speed in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gif-speed-duration-change.jpg)

## Part 2: Best Free GIF Speed Changers That Can Be Found Online

There are a few GIF speed changers which can be found online, free of charge, with varying levels of effectiveness and ease of usability dependent on the device you are using to create your GIF.

### 1. EZGIF.com

This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:

* No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site
* Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage

![change gif speed in EZgif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-ezgif.jpg)

To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <https://ezgif.com/speed>.

Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.

### 2. Veed.io

This site, found at <https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.

![change gif speed in Veed.io](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-veed.jpg)

From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.

### 3. Lunapic

![change gif speed in Lunapic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-lunapic.jpg)

What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.

### 4. GifGit

![change gif speed in GifGit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-gifgit.jpg)

Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit> \- editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.

This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!

### 5. IMG Flip

As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.

![change gif speed in  IMG Flip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-img-flip.jpg)

Get familiar with IMG Flip through this link - <https://imgflip.com/gif-maker> \- and spend some time working through the different options available. To change the speed you simply need upload your clip and then adjust the speed as a percentage of the original clip – 100% being the starting point, with 200% running the GIF at twice the speed and 50% running it at half speed.

## Part 3: Best GIF Speed Changers for iOS And Android

There is little that can’t be done on a smartphone in today’s world. Our phones are what we have with us at all times, and so it follows that any kind of editing we hope to do should be achievable using these portable devices – after all, modern smartphones are now fitted with cameras which surpass the capability of even some of the most expensive cameras on the market. So, which are the best GIF speed changers for phones?

### 1. GIF Maker - ImgPlay

Available: [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gif-maker-imgplay/id989843523) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.imgbase.imgplay.android)

![change gif speed in  IMG Flip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-img-flip.jpg)

We start with a simple one which can be found on the app store using any search for a GIF app. This particular app plays on the concept of building your own memes, giving users a chance to enhance their own comic value on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook using their own images or multiple GIF’s strung together. We particularly love the fact that ImgPlay’s platform allows users to add their own text and emojis over the top of the visuals, completely personalising the end product and creating something which is unique for their own use. A simple slider tool allows for easy editing of the GIF speed, presenting an all-round great tool for beginners and experience GIF makers alike.

### 2. Imgur – Funny Meme and GIF Maker

Available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imgur.mobile&hl=en&gl=US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imgur-funny-meme-gif-maker/id639881495) users

![change gif speed in Imgur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-imgur.jpg)

The Imgur app is one of the most popular GIF creation tools out there – offering users with a platform which allows them edit as many GIFs as they like, play with the speed of existing and new GIFs, and share their creations with other users who can share your designs and help you go viral. As much an online community as a GIF editing tool, Imgur could well be the new Instagram – if Instagram suddenly decided to wave goodbye to the influencers and adverts and make way for user built content and humorous motion videos instead!

### 3. GIF Camera

Exclusive to [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.listen5.gif&hl=en)

![change gif speed in  GIF Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-gif-camera.jpg)

This is a tool which supports the creation of GIFs using actions and movements which you capture on camera straight into the app. Opening the app, you simply select the camera feature and capture the movement or motion – before diving into the editing of speed, colour, appearance and overlays. A great tool which is instant to use and allows you to create funny and more serious GIFs depending on the movement you capture.

### 4. Gifx

Launched as an [iPhone tool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gifx-gif-maker-gif-creator/id1174686031)

![change gif speed in  Gifx](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-gifx.jpg)

This platform is designed to allow users to edit and add to existing GIFs which they may want to adjust, add filters to and overlay with music. As with many of the other portable device tools created for Android and iPhone, the main features of this app are its user friendly interface and the fact that all GIFs created can be downloaded directly to the phone or uploaded straight to social media – depending on how the user intends to use their GIF.

### 5. GIF Studio

Finally, an Android tool.

![change gif speed in  GIF Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-gif-studio.jpg)

One of the fastest tools both to understand and to use, GIF studio really lets you feel like you are in a proper video editing studio – even when using the limited screen size of your phone. Users can edit the speed on existing GIFs or can create new collages with multiple GIFs, benefitting from added animation and colour and visual effects without losing the quality of the original imagery or footage.

#### GIF Speed Changer FAQ

**Can I slow down a GIF?**

In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.

**How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?**

Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.

**How do you make a GIF 30fps?**

This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.

**Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?**

Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.

The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.

But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.

If you are looking for a gif editor that empowers you to create gifs better, you should try some desktop tools. Here I recommend you using Filmora to change gif speed and edit further.

## Part 2: Best Free GIF Speed Changers That Can Be Found Online

There are a few GIF speed changers which can be found online, free of charge, with varying levels of effectiveness and ease of usability dependent on the device you are using to create your GIF.

### 1. EZGIF.com

This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:

* No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site
* Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage

![change gif speed in EZgif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-ezgif.jpg)

To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <https://ezgif.com/speed>.

Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.

### 2. Veed.io

This site, found at <https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.

![change gif speed in Veed.io](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-veed.jpg)

From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.

### 3. Lunapic

![change gif speed in Lunapic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-lunapic.jpg)

What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.

### 4. GifGit

![change gif speed in GifGit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-gifgit.jpg)

Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit> \- editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.

This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!

### 5. IMG Flip

As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.

Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.

The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.

But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.

## Part 1: Best GIF Speed Changer Software: Wondershare Filmora

If you are looking for a gif editor that empowers you to create gifs better, you should try some desktop tools. Here I recommend you using Filmora to change gif speed and edit further.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an easy-to-use video editor for all creators. With its user-friendly interface, a wide range of editing tools, and tons of video effects, you can create videos and change the speed of gifs easily.

1. With your gifs open on the screen, right click and select **Speed** **and Duration** .
2. In the Custom Speed window, you will see a speed slider locates at the middle, which indicates the default 1.x speed. And the Duration option suggests the duration of the gif.
3. To change the speed of gif, you can drag the speed slider forward or backward to speed up or slow down the playback. Or, you can just enter the number to a specific duration.
4. With such an easy process for changing the GIF speed, users will find they can adjust the clip to their hearts content, until they achieve the perfect finish.

## Part 2: Best Free GIF Speed Changers That Can Be Found Online

There are a few GIF speed changers which can be found online, free of charge, with varying levels of effectiveness and ease of usability dependent on the device you are using to create your GIF.

### 1. EZGIF.com

This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:

* No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site
* Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage

![change gif speed in EZgif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-ezgif.jpg)

To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <https://ezgif.com/speed>.

Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.

### 2. Veed.io

This site, found at <https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.

![change gif speed in Veed.io](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-veed.jpg)

From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.

### 3. Lunapic

![change gif speed in Lunapic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-lunapic.jpg)

What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.

### 4. GifGit

![change gif speed in GifGit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-gifgit.jpg)

Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit> \- editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.

This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!

### 5. IMG Flip

As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.

![change gif speed in  IMG Flip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-img-flip.jpg)

Get familiar with IMG Flip through this link - <https://imgflip.com/gif-maker> \- and spend some time working through the different options available. To change the speed you simply need upload your clip and then adjust the speed as a percentage of the original clip – 100% being the starting point, with 200% running the GIF at twice the speed and 50% running it at half speed.

## Part 3: Best GIF Speed Changers for iOS And Android

There is little that can’t be done on a smartphone in today’s world. Our phones are what we have with us at all times, and so it follows that any kind of editing we hope to do should be achievable using these portable devices – after all, modern smartphones are now fitted with cameras which surpass the capability of even some of the most expensive cameras on the market. So, which are the best GIF speed changers for phones?

### 1. GIF Maker - ImgPlay

Available: [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gif-maker-imgplay/id989843523) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.imgbase.imgplay.android)

![change gif speed in  IMG Flip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-img-flip.jpg)

We start with a simple one which can be found on the app store using any search for a GIF app. This particular app plays on the concept of building your own memes, giving users a chance to enhance their own comic value on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook using their own images or multiple GIF’s strung together. We particularly love the fact that ImgPlay’s platform allows users to add their own text and emojis over the top of the visuals, completely personalising the end product and creating something which is unique for their own use. A simple slider tool allows for easy editing of the GIF speed, presenting an all-round great tool for beginners and experience GIF makers alike.

### 2. Imgur – Funny Meme and GIF Maker

Available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imgur.mobile&hl=en&gl=US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imgur-funny-meme-gif-maker/id639881495) users

![change gif speed in Imgur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-imgur.jpg)

The Imgur app is one of the most popular GIF creation tools out there – offering users with a platform which allows them edit as many GIFs as they like, play with the speed of existing and new GIFs, and share their creations with other users who can share your designs and help you go viral. As much an online community as a GIF editing tool, Imgur could well be the new Instagram – if Instagram suddenly decided to wave goodbye to the influencers and adverts and make way for user built content and humorous motion videos instead!

### 3. GIF Camera

Exclusive to [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.listen5.gif&hl=en)

![change gif speed in  GIF Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-gif-camera.jpg)

This is a tool which supports the creation of GIFs using actions and movements which you capture on camera straight into the app. Opening the app, you simply select the camera feature and capture the movement or motion – before diving into the editing of speed, colour, appearance and overlays. A great tool which is instant to use and allows you to create funny and more serious GIFs depending on the movement you capture.

### 4. Gifx

Launched as an [iPhone tool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gifx-gif-maker-gif-creator/id1174686031)

![change gif speed in  Gifx](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-gifx.jpg)

This platform is designed to allow users to edit and add to existing GIFs which they may want to adjust, add filters to and overlay with music. As with many of the other portable device tools created for Android and iPhone, the main features of this app are its user friendly interface and the fact that all GIFs created can be downloaded directly to the phone or uploaded straight to social media – depending on how the user intends to use their GIF.

### 5. GIF Studio

Finally, an Android tool.

![change gif speed in  GIF Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-gif-studio.jpg)

One of the fastest tools both to understand and to use, GIF studio really lets you feel like you are in a proper video editing studio – even when using the limited screen size of your phone. Users can edit the speed on existing GIFs or can create new collages with multiple GIFs, benefitting from added animation and colour and visual effects without losing the quality of the original imagery or footage.

#### GIF Speed Changer FAQ

**Can I slow down a GIF?**

In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.

**How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?**

Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.

**How do you make a GIF 30fps?**

This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.

**Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?**

Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.

## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

## Conclusion

● The fact remains that the efficiency of your editing software or tool has a huge influence on your productivity. And even though choosing the best video trimmer for your next project might seem dicey, following a simple review like this will make it easy to select from the best and try to know what works best for you.
