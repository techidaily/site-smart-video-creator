**Step 2: Select the Split Screen Effect**

Select the top video layer in the Timeline, and choose **Split Screen** from the screen type drop-down list at the top.

**Step 3: Select Split Screen Preset**

### FAQs About Split Screen Video Editors

#### Why you should use split screen effect in video?

* Comparing multiple objects or picture quality. This can be done only when the entities in question are placed side-by-side
* Making your video look more professional
* Showing different effects on the same screen

#### Can I create a split screen video with Windows Movie Maker or Windows 10 Photos app?

No, you cannot. Although these tools enable you to resize the videos, since they don’t allow multi-tracked Timelines, no video clips can be placed one above the other which is an essential part for any **split screen video maker** to create the effect. However, as discussed above, there are several post-production tools, offline and online, that allow you to make split screen videos easily and without any cost.

**Conclusion**
