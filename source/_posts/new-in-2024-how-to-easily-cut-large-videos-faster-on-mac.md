![Blade your clip ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-in-fcp-2.png)

Once you have obtained your two scenes for which you need to add transition effect then select the very first scene from the timeline. Now open the Video animation window on your device, it can be done by pressing Shift+V; find the Compositing option, and then apply default transitions by simply dragging timeline handle towards both sides of the composite window. In FCP, Cross dissolve will be selected as the default transition.
