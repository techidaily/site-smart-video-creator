#### 4. Blur face with Adobe Premiere Pro CC professional video editor

**Premiere Pro CC** is Adobe’s dedicated video editing software. There are many video editors out there that have some experience in Photoshop as well, and since there’s a chance they work in Premiere Pro CC due to how similar the UI of both of these products is, we’ve decided to give this NLE some attention as well.

1. **Select** the video clip in the timeline.
2. Access the **Effects** tab, and then click **Video Effects,** and then **Stylize**.
3. Click **Mosaic**.
4. Go to the **Effects Control** tab, and pick the shape of blurred area. The elliptical and 4-point polygon mask options are what most people use when blurring faces in particular.
5. Drag the **Mask** over the intended area
6. Adjust **Positioning**, **Scale**, **and**/**or Rotation** to your liking.
7. You can fine-tune the effect further by adjusting the **Mask Expansion,** the **Horizontal and Vertical** blocks the mosaic effect is composed of, and the **Feather**

What sort of video editing software you go for when you want to edit the face in videos is ultimately up to you - we’ve only expressed our personal preferences in the hopes that it might help some of the people that are interested in the subject. Most of the steps present in this list are similar to each other and you will find that once you learn how to do this trick, you will become far more familiarized with all the various effects available to you.

## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.

## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.

You can play various multimedia content, but only Google Cast-supported formats can be streamed directly.

If you would like to play unsupported formats, such as MKV, VOB, FLV, and AVI, you will need to get a video format converter to stream movies, TV shows, and music videos with unsupported formats. We've picked some best video converters that you can use which also support 4K footage. Check the list of the[best 4K video converters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) here.

It requires a wireless connection using the Internet or a network-connected computer, tablet, or smartphone. You can play various multimedia content, but only Google Cast-supported formats can be streamed directly.

If you would like to play unsupported formats, such as MKV, VOB, FLV, and AVI, you will need to get a video format converter to stream movies, TV shows, and music videos with unsupported formats.

Google Chromecast is a digital media player that allows you to stream MP4, WebM, MPEG-DASH, Smooth Streaming, and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) video formats on your High Definition Television (HDTV). It requires a wireless connection using the Internet or a network-connected computer, tablet, or smartphone. You can play various multimedia content, but only Google Cast-supported formats can be streamed directly.

If you would like to play unsupported formats, such as MKV, VOB, FLV, and AVI, you will need to get a video format converter to stream movies, TV shows, and music videos with unsupported formats. We've picked some best video converters that you can use which also support 4K footage. Check the list of the[best 4K video converters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) here. In this article, you will learn about supported and unsupported video formats and how you can stream them using your Chromecast media player.

You don’t have to be a music prodigy to create an amazing music video, you don’t even have to know how to sing, because there are hundreds of iOS and Android-based apps that let you create a lip sync video. The only important thing is to move your lips and appear to be saying the same words at the exact same moment as the real singer of the song you’re covering. **Lip syncing** allows you to focus on your dancing or any other action you’re planning on doing in a video and reduces the need to perform a song perfectly.

**Lip sync videos** are a great source of fun, and producing them doesn’t require you to have a professional video or sound equipment. In this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the **best lip sync apps on iPhone and Android phones**, and we are going to show you **how to use them to create amazing lip sync videos**.

## Making Lip Sync Videos with 5 Best Lip Sync Apps

Lip syncing seems easier than it actually is because synchronizing the movement of your lips with the lyrics of a song can prove to be a challenging task. If the first take doesn’t turn out the way you wanted, keep trying because the practice is one of the most important aspects of creating a great lip sync video.

#### 1. TikTok

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ro/app/tiktok/id835599320?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.ugc.trill&hl=en%5FUS)

Currently, the app **has over 150 million daily users** and the TikTok community keeps growing at an astounding rate. You can **browse through the latest videos** on the platform or **upload your own videos**.

The **+** icon located near the bottom of the screen grants you access to the **video recording** options. To access the TikTok’s library of songs you just have to tap on the **Pick a Sound** option and select the song you want to use in your video. As you tap on a song, a **Shoot with this sound** option will appear on the screen, tap on it to begin recording a video. The **scissors icon** can be used to **set the start and end points of a song**, while the menu near the bottom of the screen lets you choose **how fast the playback** of the song is going to be. Hit the **Record** button to start making your new lip sync video and once the recording session is over hit the **Post** icon to share the video on the TikTok platform.

#### 2. Triller

The duration of all songs in the Triller’s music library is limited to just 30 seconds, and if you want to make a longer lip sync video, you have to upload a song from your device.

Tapping the Capture button will start the video recording session and while you’re recording you can zoom in or zoom out in order to change the composition of the shot. The app’s auto editing algorithm will render the video after you stop recording, but you can still add emojis, stickers or filters to each lip sync video you create with this app, by selecting the Re Edit option. The videos you produce with this app can be shared on all of the most popular social media or on the Triller platform

#### 3. [Dubsmash](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dubsmash-lip-sync-dance/id918820076?mt=8)
