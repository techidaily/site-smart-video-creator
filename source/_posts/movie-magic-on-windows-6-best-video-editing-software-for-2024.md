### 6. [Movica](https://sourceforge.net/projects/movica/)

This software is, in essence, a user interface for other open-source tools that are somewhat user-unfriendly, enabling an understandable user interface for the best free tools out there. As a software package though, there is nothing wrong with this approach, and the tools available for joining and merging are first-rate, and the software works very fast, whilst offering a wide range of compatible video formats.

The interface is a little clunky, but it does the job and the software has additional tools for other editing work such as cutting and trimming as well, the added functionality in combination with a more basic interface can make some operations a touch confusing though.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Back in 1999, Apple launched Final Cut Pro, and the software didn't take so long to become the first choice for video editors and post-production agencies.

The main feature it has that makes it stands out from any other video-editing software out there is that it is made exclusively to operate on Mac only, and that allowed Apple to make it fully enhanced for speed and efficiency enabling it to[**edit 4K**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) **UHD footage** with no rendering issues.

This video editing software will cost you $300 to buy, and as mentioned above it will require you to have a Mac OS, so if you don't have both or if you are a[beginner in video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) we are suggesting a few alternatives for you that you might choose one from to start your video editing journey.

## Best Free & Paid Final Cut Pro X Alternatives on Windows/ Mac/ Linux

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 2. [Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/)

Avidemux is a **free open-source and cross-platform** (Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X) video editor designed for quick video joining, trimming, and filtering tasks. It supports different video formats such as MP44, MPG, AVI, OGM, MKV, FLV, and more. Here is also a [getting-started tutorial for Avidemux](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can refer to.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/avidemux.jpg)

**Pros as an alternative to FCPX for Windows:**

* Open-source video editing software and free
* A simple interface and easy to use

**Cons:**

May have problems dealing with some types of formats.

### 3. [VirtualDub](http://www.virtualdub.org/)

VirtualDub is a strong video editing tool on Windows with many useful features that can help you make different kinds of changes to the video but keeping the video’s quality the same as before. It also has batch-processing capabilities for processing large numbers of files and can be extended with third-party video filters.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Has video capturing option;
* Can be extended with third-party video filters;
* Has batch-processing capabilities for processing large numbers of files.

**Cons:**

Outdated UI design.

### 4. [Video Toolbox](https://www.videotoolbox.com/)

Video Toolbox is a[free online video editing tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)that has a rich set of video functions. But like many online apps, it imposes a size restriction of 300 MB for your video files. To use it, you have to register first and upload the target files either from the hard disk or online video sites. Then fish the merging task use the command from a drop-down.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-toolbox.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Supports many video formats;
* Different video editing options.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/format-factory.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Supports many video formats;
* Basic video editing options.

**Cons:**

Can't convert audio files.

### 6. [Movica](https://sourceforge.net/projects/movica/)

This software is, in essence, a user interface for other open-source tools that are somewhat user-unfriendly, enabling an understandable user interface for the best free tools out there. As a software package though, there is nothing wrong with this approach, and the tools available for joining and merging are first-rate, and the software works very fast, whilst offering a wide range of compatible video formats.

The interface is a little clunky, but it does the job and the software has additional tools for other editing work such as cutting and trimming as well, the added functionality in combination with a more basic interface can make some operations a touch confusing though.

![Movica](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/movica.jpg)

Ultimately a little more complicated to use, but very good.

### 7. [Cyberlink PowerDirector 365](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html)

PowerDirector 365 is a professional video editor in the Cyberlink family. It is a great [Final Cut Pro alternative on Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

With the new color grading features, VEGAS PRO 17 can compete with Final Cut Pro.

![VEGAS PRO 17](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/vegas-pro-17.jpg)

Very fast video editing with the newly released version.

### 9. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

* The free version is full of annoying notifications

**G2 Rating:** 4 Stars

**Supported OS:** [Windows](https://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html), [Mac](https://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/vpmaci.zip)

**User Review**

A [G2 reviewer](https://www.g2.com/products/videopad/reviews/videopad-review-3737834) states, "This complete and powerful media editing tool offers a variety of possibilities and possibilities to optimize every clip to the fullest."

**Takeaway**

VideoPad Video Editor has many free features you can use to improve your videos. Admittedly, there are problems with some of these features. Nevertheless, this tool is a solid choice for a Windows iMovie alternative.

### 8\. [Lightworks](https://lwks.com/)

Lightworks Pro is a video editor used to make some Oscar-winning films, and Lightworks is a free and less complicated version of it. However, Lightworks is still not that beginner-friendly. Therefore, it's best to consider this as an iMovie alternative only if you are an intermediate user.

![lightworks interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/10/imovie-for-windows-11-5.jpg)

**Key Features**

* Advanced Color Correction
* Some advanced tools
* Tooltips to help you learn how to use the features
* Integration to Cloud services
* Keyframing
* Advanced audio controls
* Autosave

**Price**

Lightworks is free, but premium subscriptions for Lightworks Create costs $99.9, and Lightworks Pro costs $24.99.

 Pros

* Includes Advanced tools
* You would not lose progress because of the autosave feature
* Good performance

 Cons

* Not suited for beginners
* You can only export up to 720p using the free version

**G2 Rating: 3.5 Stars**

**Supported OS** [Windows](https://lwks.com/), [Mac](https://lwks.com/), [Linux](https://lwks.com/)

**User Review**

A [TrustRadius Ratings and Review](http://trustradi.us/A9272) says, "Lightworks is a great tool for a non-designer to use because it provides a number of tools and capabilities that can be quickly learned." However, they note that Lightworks does not provide advanced video editors with all the tools they need. It's best for intermediate users.

**Takeaway**

Lightworks is a fantastic alternative to iMovie for Windows 10+ users. However, it requires you to be quite knowledgeable about video editing tools. This editor has a slightly higher learning curve than others. But once you learn how to use Lightworks, creating quality videos would be super easy.

### 9\. [Flexclip - Easy-to-Use Online Editor](https://www.flexclip.com/)

![flexclip interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/10/imovie-for-windows-11-2.jpg)

FlexClip is a free online editor. It is a good substitute for iMovie for Windows users, regardless if you are a beginner or a professional.

**Key Features**

* Dozens of useful tools like background remover and gif maker
* Voice and screen recorder
* Integration with social media platforms
* It supports all the popular video formats
* Allows you to export up to 1080p

**Price**

FlexClip is free, but premium subscriptions are available. Subscriptions start from $9.99 per month.

 Pros

* Includes basic and advanced editing tools

**G2 Rating: 4.5 Stars**

**Supported OS:** [Windows](https://www.flexclip.com/)[,](https://www.flexclip.com/)[Mac](https://www.flexclip.com/), [Linux](https://www.flexclip.com/)

**User Review**

FlexClip being an online video editor means one thing; it does not use your PC's processing power. It also delivers what it promises. A [G2 reviewe](https://www.g2.com/products/flexclip/reviews/flexclip-review-5138003)r says, "I have used many video editing tools so far, but none is close to FlexClip when it comes to video editing."

**Takeaway**

You can't go wrong with FlexClip. It has powerful tools making it a great iMovie alternative for Windows. You don't even have to install it; it's an online tool. Unfortunately, that has some downsides. You need to wait for the website to finish loading before working because it scrolls down for each line that gets loaded.

### 10\. [WeVideo - Best for Templates](https://www.wevideo.com/)

WeVideo includes social-media-friendly templates, making it a fantastic choice for editing popular video categories like How-to, Unboxings, and Makeup tutorials.

**Key Features**

**User Review**

Social media influencers and marketers need to check out WeVideo.

**Takeaway**

WeVideo is a solid alternative for iMovie for Windows 10/11, but only if you are willing to pay. The free version has lots of restrictions. For example, you can only export 5 minutes of content per month.

### 11\. [OpenShot - Best for Amateurs](https://www.openshot.org/)

![openshot interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/10/imovie-for-windows-11-1.jpg)

OpenShot has a straightforward interface, making it beginner-friendly. It has some fantastic tools you'll find helpful. There's a catch with beginner-friendly editors, though. They don't have the advanced features you can find on other video editors. You can say that for OpenShot.

**Key Features**

* 3D Animation
* Text Editor
* Keyframing
* Decent selection of templates and filters

**Price:** Free

 Pros

* Beginner-friendly

A [G2 review](https://www.g2.com/products/openshot-video-editor/reviews/openshot-video-editor-review-6946676) states, "I do not have a degree in video editing, but the products from my Openshot edits were of high quality."

**Takeaway**

Some tools are intimidating for beginners; there are many buttons, and you don't know what each one does. That's not a problem when using OpenShot. Its simple interface is easy to understand, making it the best tool for beginners.
