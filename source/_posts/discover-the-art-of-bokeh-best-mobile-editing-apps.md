## Part 1: What is the Bokeh Effect and Why Should I Be Using it?

The word “Bokeh”or “boke” refers to the Japanese concept of “blur.” It is, in its simplest form, a style of photography where one object is the primary focus, and everything else is strategically blurred.

Using the Bokeh effect is an excellent way to separate the focal point of your photo from non-focal points. It not only serves the purpose of highlighting the focus of the image, but can also help when you’re looking to get rid of an unpleasant or unwanted background. The blurred background is meant to keep your focal point at the absolute center of your audience’s attention.

## Part 2: Top 10 Best Apps to Achieve the Bokeh Effect for iOS and Android

As mentioned, there are other ways to achieve the Bokeh effect without an expensive and often fidget DSLR camera. The following apps have been deemed the best based on a variety of characteristics which will be mentioned below.

## Part 3: Creating the Bokeh Effect Using the Portrait Mode Function on Your iPhone

If using a third-party app seems like too much effort, or you don’t find the app that achieves the exact blur to focus ratio you’re looking for, consider using the Portrait Mode feature available on newer iPhone models.

Portrait mode is a camera function that allows users to create the depth of field effect we know as Bokeh. When used, the focal image will be crisp and sharp, while the background will be blurred nicely so as to not cause a distraction to the focal point.

To achieve the Bokeh effect through Portrait Mode, you must:

1. Open up your camera app and along the bottom of your screen find and select **Portrait**, and select from a variety of portrait mode options, including Natural light, studio light, contour light, stage light, stage light mono, high key light mono;

![add bokeh effects with Portrait Mode on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-portrait-mode-option.jpg)

2. The different modes offered will allow users to achieve different types of blur.
