Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu.

With this amazing tool you can combine split videos quickly and easily with few clicks. It is simple to use and all you need to do is to drag and drop your files into the pane designated for joining files. Once you place them in the order you want, select the “Run AVI Joiner” button. You will need to clearly instruct the application to save the final video output at a place you can retrieve it and remember to keep the .avi extension.
