 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Itâ€™s very common that you filmed some amazing portrait or landscape videos but in the wrong direction. This is an error made by many people because not everyone will always think about orientation when filming. Is there an easy way to flip/rotate videos so that you can watch them without turning your head sideways?

In the following, Iâ€™ll describe how to flip a video in Windows using this video flip program. If youâ€™re a Mac user, just adopt Wondershare Filmora X for Mac (Latest Filmora version X for Mac) to achieve the same.

First, please download Filmora X for free as per your operating system, and then follow the steps below.

* **Rotate:** rotate video at any angle by entering the angle value or moving the Rotate slide: rotate 90Â° clockwise & anti-clockwise, rotate at 180Â°, rotate 270Â°, and more
* **Flip:** Flip video horizontally, i.e. flip video left to right; flip video vertically that is fliping video upside down
* You can combine Rotate and Flip feature to flip video vertically and rotate 90Â°clockwise or flip video vertically and rotate 90Â°counterclockwise.
