[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/) is the latest of media sharing applications to cause a worldwide frenzy and gain a huge number of users practically overnight. A big reason for its success is the large number of fun features that allow the users to alter their videos with just a few clicks.

With cool effects and filters, it’s possible to create a wide range of videos that catch the viewer’s attention and put a smile on his face. On the other hand, videos can be created and shared from mobile phones in seconds, enabling its users to show a lot of different situations and express a lot of ideas.

Reversing is also one of the popular options on TikTok and it can be readily performed even without deeper knowledge of video production and editing. Here is how you can do it effectively, either with built-in tools provided by TikTok or with additional pieces of software.

* [Part 2: How to Play Someone Else's TikTok Video in Reverse?](#part2)
* [Part 3: Reverse A Video on CupCut And Share It on TikTok?](#part3)
* [Part 4: How to Reverse Video and Audio at The Same Time?](#part4)
* [Part 5: How to Reverse A TikTok Video on Snapchat?](#part5)

## How to Make A Reversing TikTok Video?

Changing the direction of the video, i.e. playing it backwards, is not hard to achieve on TikTok at all. In fact, there is a dedicated function you can use to reverse your video instantly and without leaving the app.

To activate this function, you need to click on the Effects button at the bottom of the screen and then select the Time effects category. The reverse option can be found in this menu, and it will change the direction of the entire clip.

![Reverse video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-video-on-tiktok.jpg)

After you click on Reverse and review your new video, all you need to do is to save the file and it is ready to be shared with the public. The entire process lasts just a few seconds and doesn’t require any technical skills, so anyone can take advantage of this simple effect to create exciting videos that play with the concept of time and resonate with the online audience.

## How to Play Someone Else’s Video in Reverse on TikTok?

TikTok only allows video authors to reverse their own videos if they want, but viewers can’t just watch the videos they see online backwards. They are limited to straightforward viewing, although it is possible to jump forward to any part of the clip.

![Reverse Vid for iOS](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-vid-play-it-backwards.jpg)

The only solution to this limitation involves external playback tools, so if you really want to watch a certain video in reverse you could try to download it to your phone and use a different video player. For example, iPhone owners can pick up a third-party app like [Reverse Vid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reverse-vid-play-it-backwards/id950551948) from the App Store that lets them use reverse playback. Once the app is installed and the video is stored on the phone, there is nothing preventing the user from watching it backwards on the mobile screen.

## How to Reverse A Video on CupCut And Share It on TikTok?

Users who know a bit more about video editing and want more control over the final product can use external tools instead of TikTok’s own function. There are many video editors for TikTok that could do the trick, but CupCut is one of the simplest apps that will work from your phone and can be downloaded for free.

In CupCut, you can precisely select the part of the video you want to reverse and even adjust playback speed if you want. That gives you more creative freedom and unlocks the possibility to attempt more ambitious visual ideas.

Of course, once you reverse the video in CupCut you will need to export it to TikTok before you can share it with your contacts. Since both of those apps support the same video formats, this process should run very smoothly and without any compatibility issues.

## Is It Possible to Reverse Video and Audio at The Same Time?

In some cases, reversing the audio stream could make the video even more impressive but unfortunately, TikTok doesn’t directly support this possibility. However, more [advanced editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) suits give you the option to have both video and audio run backwards in unison. For example, you can use [Wondershare Filmora](https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html) for this purpose and accomplish the task in several easy steps.

First, you need to set up the project to 9:16 [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) since the video will be shared on TikTok. And then you can import the video footage to Filmora.

To reverse the video and audio at the same time, right-click the clip in the timeline and then select **Speed and Duration**. In the Custom Speed window, check the **Reverse Speed** option and click **OK** to save the changes.

Play the clip and you will find the video and audio is reversed at the same time.

If you don’t want to reverse the audio, you can [detach the audio from the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) first and then reverse the video separately.

When you complete these steps, you are ready to export the video and re-import the reversed clip back into TikTok.

## How to Reverse A TikTok Video on Snapchat?

To share a TikTok video on Snapchat, you should first download the TikTok video and then open Snapchat.

Go to Snapchat Memories and access the camera roll, and then choose the TikTok video. Click the three dots button on the top right of the screen and then click Edit Video. In the editing mode, swipe the screen to left, you will see the video in slow motion, fast motion, and then the rewind effect. Now, the uploaded TikTok is reversed on Snapchat.

## Part 2 Everything You Need to Know About LinkedIn Ad Specs

The specs can vary in the case of LinkedIn videos and LinkedIn ads. As the ads are totally different from the videos their specs also become different. Here are some of the specs that you should know when you are creating LinkedIn ads:

**●** **Length:** The maximum and minimum length of these ad videos are 3 seconds to 30 minutes respectively. However, the most successful video length is up to 15 seconds.

**●** **File size and file format:** The file size of the ad videos must be a minimum of 75 KB and the maximum it can be of 200 MB. The file format that is supported on the LinkedIn application is MP4.

## Part 3 5 types of LinkedIn Ads

LinkedIn provides you with several platforms and types of ad placements. Here mentioned are some of them:

**Sponsored messages in LinkedIn:** This type of LinkedIn ad was previously termed as sponsored InMail. Through this, you can directly advertise your product or brand in the user’s inbox. However, LinkedIn has set a maximum number of times that your customer can receive the messaging ad. This states that any member of your audience will not receive the ads more than two times in a short span of time. Also, it is estimated that consumers enjoy messaging ads but companies do not interact much with them via sponsored messaging ads.

![Sponsored messaging on LinkedIn](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/linkedin-video-aspect-ratio-2.jpg)

**Sponsored content:** These ads show up in the feed of the LinkedIn user. No matter if they are using it on mobile on desktop. These sponsored contents also have a label of promotion on them. This makes them different from the regular contents. If you are choosing sponsored content then you also get the choice between carousel ads, video ads and images ads.

![Sponsored content on LinkedIn](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/linkedin-video-aspect-ratio-3.jpg)

**Dynamic ads:** These ads are visible on the right rail as you open the LinkedIn. Also this is the best way to speak to your audience through personalization. The users get to see their own personal details as soon these ads pop up on the screen.

## Part 1: How to Add a Skin Smoother Effect without Plugins in Final Cut Pro?

Smoothening the skin in Final Cut Pro is very simple. Simply select the video, choose Video effects to be applied, and adjust the percentages from the Inspector pane. You will get wrinkle-free skin with an astonishing look. While multiple plugins are also available to apply a skin smoother effect, you can use the built-in features of Final Cut Pro to smoothen the skin and decrease the amount of contrast.

Here’s how you can do this:

step1Choose the starting image and edit the clip into the timeline. Press Option and make a connected copy of the clip by dragging it up. The start and end points should match for syncing. In the Effects Browser, drag Blur > Gaussian Blur to apply the blur effect on the upper clip.

![Skin_Smoother_Effect_1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_1.jpg)

step2Open the Inspector pan and select Compositing from its bottom. Switch the Blend Mode to Lighten and adjust the Opacity slider as per your desired glow. Usually, 40 to 45% is ideal.

![Skin_Smoother_Effect_2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_2.jpg)

step3Now, go to the top of the Inspector and turn on the blue checkbox next to Gaussian. Adjust the blurring effect until you achieve your desired level of skin softening. It is highly recommended to blur using the horizontal setting to soften the skin while keeping the eyes sharp. Here, the glow is controlled by Opacity while skin softening is controlled by the Blue Amount.

![Skin_Smoother_Effect_3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_3.jpg)

For better results, add a Vignette by selecting and combining the two clips into a Compound Clip. From the Effects Browser, select Stylize > Vignette and adjust drag the vignette. Now, customize the compound clip settings in the Inspector pane until you achieve your desired look. Compare the results between two images before and after editing

Given below are simple steps to create a face matter, control the skin smoothing, adjust color correction, and correct the skin glow in Adobe Pro by using the Beauty Studio Effect:

Hence, turn on the Pixel Chooser, pick two colors with the eye dropper tool. Color A for the darker area and Color B for the lighter area.
2. Underneath the Mocha Matte, use the eyedropper tool to select colors on the skin of the subject in your footage.
3. Now, click on View Matte/Mask to visualize the image areas where you are applying the skin smoothing effect. The Beauty Studio will affect the smoothing effect in the white area while the black area will remain unsmoothed.

6. Beauty Studio offers four levels of skin smoothing. You can adjust these levels as per your situation by lowering the smoothing amount for each level. For better results, adjust the levels at 70 or below.
7. For the final touch, adjust the sharpening between 10-20 points, add saturation between 3 to 8 points for color correction, and add 5 to 10 points of glow. Your image is ready, compare the results before and after applying the effect.

**Conclusion**

Smooth skin with clear facial expressions attracts everyone. You can apply a skin smooth effect in your video by using advanced video editing tools like Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premium, and Wondershare Filmora.

There are two methods to add a skin smooth effect with FCPX: By using in-built software settings, or by using plugins like Skin Smoother 2, Color Finale, and Universe.

Now, let’s understand what a skin smoother effect is before learning how to add it in FCPX.

> * [Part 2: Where to Find Good Skin Smoother Plugins?](#part2)
> * [Part 3: How to adopt Skin Smoothing Plugins into FCPX?](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Add a Skin Smoother Effect without Plugins in Final Cut Pro?

Smoothening the skin in Final Cut Pro is very simple. Simply select the video, choose Video effects to be applied, and adjust the percentages from the Inspector pane. You will get wrinkle-free skin with an astonishing look. While multiple plugins are also available to apply a skin smoother effect, you can use the built-in features of Final Cut Pro to smoothen the skin and decrease the amount of contrast.

Here’s how you can do this:

step1Choose the starting image and edit the clip into the timeline. Press Option and make a connected copy of the clip by dragging it up. The start and end points should match for syncing. In the Effects Browser, drag Blur > Gaussian Blur to apply the blur effect on the upper clip.

![Skin_Smoother_Effect_1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_1.jpg)

step2Open the Inspector pan and select Compositing from its bottom. Switch the Blend Mode to Lighten and adjust the Opacity slider as per your desired glow. Usually, 40 to 45% is ideal.

![Skin_Smoother_Effect_2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_2.jpg)

step3Now, go to the top of the Inspector and turn on the blue checkbox next to Gaussian. Adjust the blurring effect until you achieve your desired level of skin softening. It is highly recommended to blur using the horizontal setting to soften the skin while keeping the eyes sharp. Here, the glow is controlled by Opacity while skin softening is controlled by the Blue Amount.

![Skin_Smoother_Effect_3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_3.jpg)

For better results, add a Vignette by selecting and combining the two clips into a Compound Clip. From the Effects Browser, select Stylize > Vignette and adjust drag the vignette. Now, customize the compound clip settings in the Inspector pane until you achieve your desired look. Compare the results between two images before and after editing

Given below are simple steps to create a face matter, control the skin smoothing, adjust color correction, and correct the skin glow in Adobe Pro by using the Beauty Studio Effect:

Hence, turn on the Pixel Chooser, pick two colors with the eye dropper tool. Color A for the darker area and Color B for the lighter area.
2. Underneath the Mocha Matte, use the eyedropper tool to select colors on the skin of the subject in your footage.

4. Adjust the Saturation, Hue, and Luma softness to enhance the appearance of the skin, eyes, and mouth.
5. To prevent the rest of the image from getting affected, create a Mocha mask around the face by clicking on the Mocha logo and drawing a mask with the X-Spline tool. Make sure the mask moves as the subject is moved after your track forward and back.
6. Beauty Studio offers four levels of skin smoothing. You can adjust these levels as per your situation by lowering the smoothing amount for each level. For better results, adjust the levels at 70 or below.
7. For the final touch, adjust the sharpening between 10-20 points, add saturation between 3 to 8 points for color correction, and add 5 to 10 points of glow. Your image is ready, compare the results before and after applying the effect.
