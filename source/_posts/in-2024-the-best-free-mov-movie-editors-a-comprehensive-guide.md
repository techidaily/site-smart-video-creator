Although some users find difficulty identifying specific Final Cut Pro X tools, some incredibly potent but frequently overlooked tools are still under the lid.

## Part 1: How to Create Jump Cuts with Markers in Final Cut Pro X?

Jump cuts are a sort of split edit performed on your video where you can jump over your video clips to keep the desire and delete the unwanted. Although it might seem similar to cut operation, jump cuts are preferable by YouTubers and vloggers. Here is a guide to teach **how to do jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro** with markers.

**Step 1: Create a fresh project and import media files**

A blue marker will be on the video timeline. Similarly, you can place markers on places wherever required.

**Step 3: Apply jump cuts**

Lastly, to apply quick jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro, tap the speed icon from the timeline where you will get various options from which you need to click the “**Jump Cuts at Markers**” option.

You can specify the frame range based on which the jump cuts will get executed in the video.

## Part 2: How to Fix a Jump Cut in Final Cut Pro X?

If you do jump cuts with markers in FCPX, you do not need to fix it, but if you opt for the other way of cut and delete, you must set them for a smoother process. Let's take a look at **how to fix a jump cut** by transition addition.
