VirtualDub is a free video capture/processing tool for Windows platforms (2000/XP/Vista/7). And VirtualDub MPEG-2 is a modified version of VirtualDub that supports MPEG-2 import originally. However, just as the author said "This software is obsolete and will no longer be updated. For MPEG-2 and WMV support in the latest VirtualDub, try my plugins (MPEG-2 plugin for VirtualDub 1.8.1 or above - by editor)".

## Download and Install VirtualDub MPEG-2

You could [download VirtualDub MPEG-2](http://www.videohelp.com/download/VirtualDub-MPEG224586%20.zip?r=LcPXQgGCmNps) here and extract files to a folder. Now you get a video processing software with MPEG-2 video import supported. To run VirtualDub MPEG-2, double click the VirtualDub.exe.

## How to Use VirtualDub MPEG-2 to Compress Large MPEG-2 Videos

VirtualDub-MPEG2 is designed to work with mpeg2 video, such as Digital TV shows, un-encrypted DVD files (\*.vob) and these video files are usually in big size. Now you can compress them using VirtualDub MPEG-2.

### Step 1: Set Up Video Compression

Open your MPEG-2 video file through File/Open video file..., then go to Video/Compression to bring up the following dialog.

![virtualdub mpeg2](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-video-compression.jpg)

As shown above, select the XVID MPEG-4 codec and click Configure button to make Xvid settings.

![virtualdub mepg2 tutorial](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-mpeg2-compress.jpg)

**Note**: If Compression is disable, switch to Full processing mode first in the Video menu.

### Step 2: Set Up Audio Compression

Audio compression setup is similar to video compression, go to Audio/Full processing mode, and again Audio/Compression to open the dialog, where MPEG Layer-3 is recommended.

### Step 3: Start Compressing

Now it's the time to start processing your video, here is how:

1. Go to the File Menu
2. Select Save as AVI...
3. Select where you want to save the AVI and name it.
4. Click Save.

## Conclusion

The VirtualDub MPEG-2 needs some time to compress your video. The larger the video file is, the longer. But VirtualDub MPEG2 is a fast video processing software. Take a cup of coffee and relax. Once finished, use your favorite video player to see the compressing result.

If you don't like VirtualDub MPEG-2 and would like to find some more powerful editors, you can try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which supports Windows and Mac OS with high compatibility of input and output formats.

## Part 3: FAQ about 3D Animation Apps

### 1\. What is the best app for animation?

For the 3D animation app, we suggest using the Bot3D Editor. It is an easy-to-use anime editor that only needs dragging to complete your editing. If you know how to use keyframes, it will give you more control over animation. For example, you can make poses in many ways by keyframes.

### 2\. How do you animate a 3D object?

The best way to animate a 3D object is by using keyframes and built-in templates. As a beginner, you may not know how to make a 3D object, but with templates, you just need to choose one and start customizing it.

### 3\. Where can I animate for free?

There are so many free-to-use animation software to use. Pencil2D is a reliable tool to make animation easy. You just need to download it on the desktop to animate objects. However, it'd be best if you have a basic understanding of how to make animation. Otherwise, you may need some time to learn it first.

## Conclusion

3D animation apps are ideal for those wishing to learn new skills and heighten their creativity.

![adding new movie in stop motion studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-movie-in-stop-motion-studio.jpg)

Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button.

![changing frame rate on stop motion studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/changing-frame-rate-on-stop-motion-studio.jpg)

Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera's live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.

Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.

Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.
