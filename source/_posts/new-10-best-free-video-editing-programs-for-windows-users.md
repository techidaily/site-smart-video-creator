##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Beautifully captured cinematic footage with crystal clear results and melodious audio attracts viewers and leaves an everlasting impression. However, if there is a delay in the audio and video, you need to sync audio and video clips.

Only an advanced video-editing software like Final Cut Pro X can solve this problem and get everything lined up and cohesive. Its auto-sync feature allows you to adjust audio with video and present your footage realistically and creatively. Similarly, users can create Multicam clips and include multiple clips at any given angle with the FCPX.

## Part 1: How to Fix Audio and Video Sync Issue?

 **Why is Audio and Video out of Sync in Final Cut Pro X?**

The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.

Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.

![sync-audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/sync-audio.png)

If you are experiencing an audio and video sync problem due to an over-taxing of your computer’s processor, follow these steps to relieve processor stress and solve your problem.

* Set the Canvas size to “Fit Window”
* Prevent the Canvas and Viewer from overlapping
* Use an updated, fast, and consistent hard drive that meets the minimum software requirements of Final Cut Pro X
* Set the control panel resolution must be to 75A Hz or higher
* Do not select too many real-time audio tracks
* Turn off the Mirror to Desktop option
* Avoid opening multiple sequences simultaneously
* Render the video sequence to a single file.

## Part 2: How to Auto-sync in Final Cut Pro X?

Final Cut Pro X is an advanced and user-friendly video editing application. Its auto-sync feature automatically analyzes the audio and video clips selected in your timeline and allows you to sync video with audio.

To use this feature, use multiple audio and video clips recorded from different resources during the same take. Once you have selected, Final Cut Pro will automatically start analyzing the clips for sync points like date of file creation, markers, audio content, and time code, etc. After analyzing the clips, the syncing process will begin in which these audio and video clips will be synced together into a new clip without affecting the original clip. Even if your clips do not have any sync points, Final Cut Pro X will sync them at their respective starting points.

![dorp-window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/dorp-window.png)

Users can also use custom settings for an advanced syncing process by adjusting different parameters according to their preferences. The following section explains the manual syncing process of audio and video clips in Final Cut Pro X.

This way, you can sync Multicam using audio in the Final Cut Pro X. To verify or adjust the sync, open the Multicam clip in the Angle Editor and drag it to the left or right.

## Part 1: How to Fix Audio and Video Sync Issue?

 **Why is Audio and Video out of Sync in Final Cut Pro X?**

The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.

Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.

## Mastering Image Proportions: A Step-by-Step Ratio Guide

You might have noticed that earlier DVDs came with full screen or widescreen viewing choices. Moreover, when you choose the wrong option, it cuts off the movie parts, or the video gets surrounded by black padding.

The standard resolution of your screen stretched from a 4:3 aspect ratio to the wider one. So, producers started making movies that fit on both screens. After the standardization of aspect ratio display, broadcasters pay attention to the image ratio of clips.

So, below is the guide to find, calculate and adjust image ratio with a picture ratio calculator. Let's get started.

#### In this article

01 [What is the image ratio?](#Part 1)

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

If you want to make permanent adjustments, use a convertor or editor. "Wondershare Filmora" is the best video editor that allows you to create videos with different aspect ratios and adjust these ratios easily.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg)

The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.

**Step 5: Save and Export Rotated Video to Your Widows or MAC**

Here you will learn how to save the project and then export it. If you have already saved the project in the beginning, skip reading this part and directly hit the “Export” button.

Contrarily, you can also directly export your files without saving the project. But you won’t be able to make changes to the same project in the future as all source files will be lost. Therefore, saving the project and then exporting files is recommended.

You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg)
