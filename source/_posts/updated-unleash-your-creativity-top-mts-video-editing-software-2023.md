 We often tend to record our precious moments in video and tend to share them with others. There are many among us who like to give their videos an extra spark by editing them. For that, they use a number of video editing software that they get their hands on. To make your choice easier from thousands of software I am listing the top five in the business. My list includes Apple iMovie, Avidemux, Blender, HyperEngine AV Video Editing Software and last but not the least, Wondershare Filmora. Let us go over the specifications and shed light on the comparisons.

## Top 5 MTS Video Editing Software Recommended

#### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Although it is free, you will only avail the free version when a new Mac OS releases. For updating without moving to a new OS version of Mac, you have to buy it.

![avidemux](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/avidemux.jpg)

#### 4\. [Blender](http://www.blender.org/download/)

 From 2002, Blender has been at the top of popularity charts for video editing. This is the popular video editor for 3D videos and it is commonly used for Rigging, Modeling, Texturing videos, animating, the simulation of smoke and water etc. This software is more suited for 3D video making. The popularity this software has can only be rivaled by very few in the market. The interface of Blender is very unique. Someone with no experience with Video Editing tool can have a hard time mastering it though. The video editing software is high end software which has features like:

* Advanced Simulation Tools.
* Advanced Level Animation Tools to create perfect animated bodies.
* Accumulates multiple scenes into one file.
* It is like a library for people who want to share and borrow video content which has been created.
* It is compatible for most of the operating systems.
* Consumes much less disk space.

![blender](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/blender01.jpg)

#### 5\. [HyperEngine AV](http://sourceforge.net/projects/hyperengine/files/latest/download?source=navbar)

 This little software is also a great one for video editing. One can easily use this to create slideshows. This is an award winning software from Arboretum Systems. The software has full source code integrated. One can edit the videos from his/her collection. Capturing video using the software is very easy. Audio processing, trackless document and many other edits are also possible using this piece of software. The important features of the software are:

* Dozens of effects are there to apply on a clip.
* FireWire DV camera is used to capture the images.
* Real time transition effects can be applied which are also automated.
* Trackless audio clips can be created through audio editing.

![hyper engine av](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/hyper-engine-av.jpg)

 With the basic idea about the software and the features, we can do a small comparison to see which one gets the edge when we talk about video editors. Let us compare all five software in a table for differences and performances.

| Features      | Apple iMovie | AvideMux        | Blender         | HyperEngine     | Wondershare Filmora                                  |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed         | None         | None            | None            | None            | Excellent (30X faster)                               |
| Editing Type  | Video/Audio  | Video/Audio     | 3D Video/Audio  | Video/Audio     | Video/Audio/Photos                                   |
| Mode Type     | Single       | Single          | Single          | Single          | Two Modes. Easy Editor and Full Featured Editor Mode |
| Compatibility | Mac          | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows                                      |

 With the above comparison, it is safe to say that the top three video converters are Blender, HyperEngine AV and Wondershare. But Wondershare has a slight edge over the two in terms of space taken and mode variations. Due to its two modes, novice users as well as professionals can perform great editing of videos, photos and audios. It supports photo editing which is a great plus for the users. It works as a good downloader and converter too. That is definitely a plus for all who use this software. Again, the compatibility is a great factor working towards its favor.

 With the basic idea about the software and the features, we can do a small comparison to see which one gets the edge when we talk about video editors. Let us compare all five software in a table for differences and performances.

| Features      | Apple iMovie | AvideMux        | Blender         | HyperEngine     | Wondershare Filmora                                  |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed         | None         | None            | None            | None            | Excellent (30X faster)                               |
| Editing Type  | Video/Audio  | Video/Audio     | 3D Video/Audio  | Video/Audio     | Video/Audio/Photos                                   |
| Mode Type     | Single       | Single          | Single          | Single          | Two Modes. Easy Editor and Full Featured Editor Mode |
| Compatibility | Mac          | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows                                      |

 With the above comparison, it is safe to say that the top three video converters are Blender, HyperEngine AV and Wondershare. But Wondershare has a slight edge over the two in terms of space taken and mode variations. Due to its two modes, novice users as well as professionals can perform great editing of videos, photos and audios. It supports photo editing which is a great plus for the users. It works as a good downloader and converter too. That is definitely a plus for all who use this software. Again, the compatibility is a great factor working towards its favor.

### 1\. [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)

**Price:** $20.99 per month as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Adobe Photoshop is one of the best photo editing software ever created, which is why it is hardly surprising that it can help you to cartoon a photo. Photoshop’s rich selection of effects includes a number of effects you can use to turn a photo into a cartoon.

However, you will also have to create several layers, change blend modes, and create masks. Effects such as Sketch, Ink Outlines, or Cutout can all be used during this process, and you can also combine several effects while turning a photo into a cartoon. Needless to say, inexperienced photo editors can find this task overwhelming, because it requires a lot of patience and excellent knowledge of the software’s features.

### 2\. [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

PC owners in need of a simple photo editing software that can help them turn a photo into a cartoon are going to love using Paint.net. This is a simple photo editor that has more to offer than Microsoft Paint, and it is as easy to use.

In order to cartoon a photo with Paint.net, you just have to import it into the editor and then head over to the Effects menu. After you locate the Artistic sub-menu, you should pick the Ink Sketch option and then adjust the Coloring and Ink Outline options. Optionally, you can also add Noise to the photo you’re cartooning if it fits the style you’re trying to achieve. However, picking the right picture can turn out to be vital for the success of the cartoon process in Paint.net.

Each effect can be edited so that it fits your image better, and if you don’t like how the effect matches your photo you can always hit the undo button and try another one. Click on the Apply icon to confirm the changes you’ve made and proceed to save the cartoon you created to your hard drive.
