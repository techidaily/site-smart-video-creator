Key specifications for the cover video are enlisted below.

**Video cover Facebook size**: As such, there are no specific size guidelines issues but it is recommended to keep the size of the video less than 1.75GB. The small size will ensure that users having slower browsing speed can also watch the video in a hassle-free manner.

Dimensions of the video: A video to be used as a cover should be at least 820 X 312 pixels and to get the optimum results it is suggested to keep it around 820 X 462 pixels. If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom. Thus, to ensure that the video looks perfect on a phone as well as desktop keep the aspect ratio at 16:9 and place the important text or other content at the center.

File type of the video: Videos in MP4 or MOV format are suggested to be used as the cover video and their resolution should be a maximum of 1080p.

Duration of the video: A Facebook cover video can be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds and you can also choose to play it on a loop.
