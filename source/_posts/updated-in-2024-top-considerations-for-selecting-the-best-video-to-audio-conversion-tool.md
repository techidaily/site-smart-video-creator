**Step 1: Import and Add the Source Video to Timeline**

Launch Wondershare Filmora on your Windows or Mac computer (MacBook Pro M1 is used here), make sure that the **16:9 (Widescreen)** layout preset is selected under the **Select Project Aspect Ratio** section on the flash screen, and click **New Project**.

![Filmora start window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-start-window-mac.jpg)

Next, click to select **My Media** from the menu bar if not already selected, and from the navigation pane on the left, select **Project Media**.

![Filmora project library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-project-media-library.jpg)

Then, click Import from the **Media** box, select and import the source video to the program, drag the clip from the **Media** box to the Timeline at the bottom, and when the confirmation box appears, choose the option either under the **Keep Project Settings** or **Match to Media** sections to add the video to the Timeline.

**Step 2: Add Blur Effect**

Go to **Effects** from the menu bar, select **Default** from the top of the navigation pane on the left, and select **Utility** from the available list. From the right box, drag the **Mosaic** effect, and place it on a separate layer above the video track in the Timeline.

**Step 3: Customize the Effect to Blur a Part of Video**

Double-click the **Blur** effect in the Timeline, use the scaling handles in the preview window to scale and position the effect to cover your preferred part of the video and place it at your desired location respectively, choose a **Mosaic** style from the **Type** list present in the left box, and use the **Intensity** and **Opacity** sliders to customize further the appearance of effect as needed. Optionally, you can drag the side handles of the effect in the Timeline to adjust the duration of its visibility, and click **OK** from the bottom-right area of the upper-left box to save the changes.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Step 1: Import a Vertical Video and Add It to the Timeline**

Use the above method to import the source vertical video to Filmora X and add it to the Timeline. However, it is important to choose the button under the **Keep Project Settings** label when the confirmation box appears, so you get some real estate because of the landscape mode to add the blur effect.

**Step 2: Add Background Blur**

Go to **Effects** and choose **Default** from the left pane, as explained earlier. Next, expand the **Filters** tree if not already expanded, click to select **Background Blur** from the list, from the box on the right, choose and drag your preferred blur effect, and place it on a separate layer in the Timeline above the video track.

**Conclusion**

If you want to have full control over the post-production process, having an efficient desktop program like Wondershare Filmora X would be something you might be looking for. On the other hand, if you are not a professional editor or are not much into editing and prefer playing around with the tools for personal use, going for a decent web portal to **blur video online** is your best bet.
