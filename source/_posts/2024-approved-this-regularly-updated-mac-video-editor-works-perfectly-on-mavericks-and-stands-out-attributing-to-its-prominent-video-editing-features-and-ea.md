You will be able to export the final product in various output formats without any loss of quality.

One unique feature of Filmora for Mac is sharing video clips directly to YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook from the interface. Other notable features include motion tracking, keyframing, creating fun clips with effects, filters, titles, creating custom backgrounds or special effects with green screen, motion elements, cropping videos for different aspect ratios, color matching, auto reframing, audio ducking, and more.

Editing and previewing your video clips in Filmora is a breeze because of exclusive features specially designed for Mac computers. For instance, hardware acceleration makes editing videos faster and smoother on Macs than ever before. Moreover, the Touch Bar has full support so that you can view your footage much easier when scrolling through the timeline.

## Part 2: Top 3  Studio for Mac Alternatives

### 1\. Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro is a professional video editing software from Apple for anybody looking for a more powerful video editor for their Macs than the included iMovie. The software is also an excellent alternative for professionals creating content for TV and cinema. The latest version runs natively on M1 chip; you can expect apparent video editing improvements.

New features include transcoding media files automatically when copying or consolidating projects and downloadable user guides. Other highlighted recent features include Smart Conform, stabilization for 360-degree videos, performance improvements with RED and Canon RAW files, Inspector panel improvements, and audio crossfades.

**Price:** $299 (onetime payment, no subscription)

**Pros:**

* Fast and superb performance
* Works perfectly with Apple computers
* 360-degree video and HDR Support
* Multicam support

**Cons:**

* Lacks motion tracking and stabilization for 360-degree videos
* Integration with Adobe software seems problematic

### 2\. Lightworks

Another free video editing software that works as a good replacement for pinnacle studio for Mac is Lightworks. It's packed with many useful features, and although there is paid version, the free version has all the bells and whistles needed for beginners.

However, if you're working with 4K videos for YouTube or Vimeo—you need to get the paid version of Lightworks as this feature isn't available in the free version. The paid version costs $25 a month. The free version includes multi-cam support, high-precision video trimming, video exports at 720p, and support for most video formats.

**Price:** $25/month

**Pros:**

* Has many video tutorials
* Intuitive interface and easy to use
* The free version is ideal for beginners

**Cons:**

* No 4K video support in the free version
* Lacks predefined filters and effects

### 3\. OpenShot

With easy-to-use features, a simple interface, and real-time previews for transitions between clips, unlimited layers, and audio mixing capabilities, OpenShot is one of the top free video editing software around. One of the best things about OpenShot is that its interface allows for easy-to-use drag and drop features. If you're a Mac user and looking for a free, open-source video editor that packs more features than iMovie—OpenShot is a great alternative you can't miss.

With OpenShot's special effects engine, users can modify, reverse, slow up or slow down videos, and preview projects in real-time. Furthermore, other standard features of OpenShot include composition, image overlays, clip resizing, trimming, snapping, scaling, watermarks, video transitions, title templates, creating personalized SVG vector titles, desktop integration, adjusting fonts, colors, 3D animated titles, and more.

* Runs on entry-levels hardware

**Cons**

* Exporting videos isn't the fastest
