* After installing any of the two emulators, choose Google folder
* Then choose Google Play Store App
* Sign in via the Google Account

![install vllo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vllo-for-mac-2.jpg)

There you go, you can now use the VLLO video editor on your MacBook. Of course, the application will not be that handy, but you have to consider the fact that the application is designed for smartphones, not computers. Still, the feature set remains the same, so it will be convenient if you have already used the application beforehand.

## Part 2: Best VLLO for Mac Alternatives

Not impressed with VLLO and looking for alternatives? Well, here are the two best applications that have the capabilities to impress you. First on the list is among the most powerful video-editing tools on the internet, and second Apple’s own free program for Mac users. Read on to find which one is the best for you!

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \[YouTubers & Vloggers\]

Wondershare Filmora for Mac is recognized as the best [macOS video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software for beginners and intermediates in the industry. The reason: be it the interface, supported formats, features, or export options — the Filmora for Mac is superior in comparison to regular software.

The AI-backed interface is intuitive enough to allow even beginner-level video editors to utilize the application to the fullest; plus, it is powerful enough to impress expert video editors. Also, the software supports all video, audio, and image formats, so you do not have to waste your time with encoding before proceeding to edit the videos. Coming to the features — to sum up in brief — the Filmora for Mac contains all that is expected from video-editing software.

[![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images2022/download-mac-store.png) ](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1516822341?pt=169436&ct=pc-article-top50&mt=8)

**Why should I use the Filmora for Mac instead of VLLO? Reasons:**

* Filmora has an intuitive, modern interface that makes things like rotating, merging, trimming, splitting, cropping, and flipping videos effortless and convenient for newbies, semi-pros, or pros.
* The software is free to utilize
* Auto-color and color correction options to tune your video exactly as you want
* Easiest keyframing experience of any software; one-click options preset options to create custom animations
* The application allows you to record a voiceover directly into your project timeline.
* You can remove video noise from your footage.

### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)\[Beginners\]

Apple native iMovie is a simple and basic video editing tool that can well compete with the likes of VLLO. But there is a good reason to mention the application as the second in the list next to Filmora for Mac. And the reason: it is not as powerful, intuitive as Filmora for Mac. Mind you, iMovie includes all the basic features needed for everyday video editing. You can cut, split, trim, and apply filters, effects, and more. However, for the sake of the simple interface — Apple excluded important features like Timeline panel from the interface, giving you less control over the videos.

In all, the application is suitable for the users who do not need powerful editing features or take much control of what’s happening in the video. Still, given the fact that the application is free to utilize, it does not hurt to download the application and verify whether the application will suit your needs or not.

![imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vllo-for-mac-3.jpg)

**Why should I use iMovie instead of VLLO? Reasons:**

* First things first, iMovie interface will be much more convenient to the users on MacBook instead of the smartphone-type interface of the VLLO
* The app has all the basic editing options needed to enrich the footage looks
* Free to utilize application, no ads like VLLO

## Conclusion

VLLO may be a great tool, but it is not the only application. As indicated, software tools like Wondershare Filmora for Mac are powerful, simple, and include features that allow you to videos like a professional within minutes. Whereas the iMovie is another simple option suitable mostly for typical users who only need basic options. But if you are serious about video editing or want to edit videos like a professional by tailoring every detail exactly like you want - Filmora for Mac is the way to go!

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

We’ve picked out some of the best **audio converters** available right now based on several different factors

You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert Audio?](#Part 1)

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting 'CONVERT’.

![Start conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%204.png)

****Step 5: Download or Save File!**

Once the conversion has been completed, your **audio converter** will either give you an option to 'DOWNLOAD’ or 'SAVE’ the finished product to your device!

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…
