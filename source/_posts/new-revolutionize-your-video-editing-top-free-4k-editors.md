iTunes is probably one of the best media players ever created so it is hardly a surprise that you can use it as an MP4 to MP3 converter. You just have to add an MP4 file you’d like to convert into an MP3 to iTunes Library by clicking on the **File menu** and selecting **Add File to Library** option. Browse the computer’s hard drive until you find the file you want to add to the library and **click OK** to complete the process.

The MP4 file will be placed in the iTunes’ **Music category**, and you just have to click on it to select it. Head back to the File menu and choose the **Create MP3 Version** option from the **Convert submenu**. The conversion process will commence immediately and once it is completed you can play your freshly created MP3 file directly from iTunes.

**Pros**

* iTunes makes it easy to organize MP3 files
* The speedy file conversion process

**Cons**

* Converting large quantities of MP4 files to MP3 can be time-consuming

### 4\. Converting MP4 to MP3 Files on Windows, macOS, and Linux with VLC Player

VLC is an open-source player that enables you to play a broad range of audio and video files. It also offers some video editing and file conversion functionality that allows its users to apply effects and filters or change the format of audio and video files.

Go to the **Media menu** and click on the **Convert/Save option** or use the **Ctrl+R** keyboard shortcut to bring up the **Open Media** window. Under **File Selection**, click on the **Add icon** and proceed to choose the MP4 file you want to convert. At the bottom of this window, you’ll be able to see the **Convert/Save button**, click on it and wait for the **Convert window** to appear on the screen. Expand **the Profile drop-down** menu that is located **under Settings**, change the output file format to **MP3** and then click on the **Browse icon** next to **Destination File** to specify the destination where the new audio file is going to be saved. Click on the **Start button** and wait for the conversion process to be completed.

**Pros**
