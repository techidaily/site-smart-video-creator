The blurred background is meant to keep your focal point at the absolute center of your audience’s attention.

## Part 2: Tips for Making Better Intro Online

After going through all the intro maker websites' features above, you might have decided to create the intro of your videos to make them look more interesting. However, if you are still stuck with the decision, don't worry because we will refer to the best intro maker website in this section.

We recommend using [InVideo](https://invideo.io/make/free-intro-maker-without-watermark/) for creating your intro. Although it's a paid tool, even the free version offers more than enough features to create eye-catching intro videos. The only concern should be the watermark that it leaves, but you can always remove it through a high-quality editor or buy the premium version to get rid of it.

Moreover, we also have some useful tips for you to create a better intro online:

* Pick music that will bring your intro videos to life
* Allow Your Brand's Personality to excel in Your Intro Videos
* Consider your intro clips to be your social media business card

**Conclusion**

You can either invest a lot of time mastering high-quality professional technologies like Adobe After Effects, or you could pay big money to a freelancer to make your intro films.

However, if you're searching for a less expensive solution but still concerned about the value of your intro, we're confident you'll be able to make your ideal intro using one of the aforementioned **intro maker website.**
