This video editing software will cost you $300 to buy, and as mentioned above it will require you to have a Mac OS, so if you don't have both or if you are a[beginner in video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) we are suggesting a few alternatives for you that you might choose one from to start your video editing journey.

It supports different video formats such as MP44, MPG, AVI, OGM, MKV, FLV, and more. Here is also a [getting-started tutorial for Avidemux](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can refer to.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/avidemux.jpg)

**Pros as an alternative to FCPX for Windows:**

### 3. [VirtualDub](http://www.virtualdub.org/)

VirtualDub is a strong video editing tool on Windows with many useful features that can help you make different kinds of changes to the video but keeping the video’s quality the same as before. It also has batch-processing capabilities for processing large numbers of files and can be extended with third-party video filters.

**Pros:**

* Can be extended with third-party video filters;
* Has batch-processing capabilities for processing large numbers of files.

**Cons:**

Outdated UI design.

### 4. [Video Toolbox](https://www.videotoolbox.com/)

Video Toolbox is a[free online video editing tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)that has a rich set of video functions. But like many online apps, it imposes a size restriction of 300 MB for your video files. To use it, you have to register first and upload the target files either from the hard disk or online video sites. Then fish the merging task use the command from a drop-down.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-toolbox.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Supports many video formats;

### 6. [Movica](https://sourceforge.net/projects/movica/)

This software is, in essence, a user interface for other open-source tools that are somewhat user-unfriendly, enabling an understandable user interface for the best free tools out there. As a software package though, there is nothing wrong with this approach, and the tools available for joining and merging are first-rate, and the software works very fast, whilst offering a wide range of compatible video formats.

The interface is a little clunky, but it does the job and the software has additional tools for other editing work such as cutting and trimming as well, the added functionality in combination with a more basic interface can make some operations a touch confusing though.

![Movica](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/movica.jpg)

Ultimately a little more complicated to use, but very good.

Before we get started, we have summarized some tips for shooting time-lapse videos, hope that will help to shoot a good video footage. If you have some other tips and tricks about shooting time lapse videos, please share it on the comment below.

**Tip 1:**  Keep the Camera/phone stable with camera stabilizer or tripod.

**Tip 2:** Make sure there is enough space for shooting time-lapse video. Large capacity memory cards are always welcomed.

**Tip 3:**  Charge the battery fully before shooting and prepare a standby battery if you have.

If you wanna make a time lapse video with photos, you need set up your camera to take photos at a proper interval, such as take photo at every five second or use the built-in time lapse shooting settings in your camera. It is recommended to record or take photos for at least 20 minutes because the time lapse video will speed up. OK, now let’s start making the time lapse video:

[Tips for Recording Time Lapse Video on iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Method 1: Creating time lapse video from photos

#### 1  Import the original photos to Filmora

After installing and launch Filmora video editor, import the shot time lapse photos to it. Click **New Project** and then click the **Import** button to add your photos to the media library. You can also directly drag and drop your video to the program. Then all the imported files will appear as thumbnails in the left of the window.

![text overlay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-video-9.jpg)

You can also import the photos from the video shooting device. Just plug in the video camera, click **Import from Phone or Camera** option in Import menu, and then transfer the target media files to Filmora.

After that, you need to select and drag and drop all the photos to the first video track.

#### 2 Preview the photos

After all your photos are placed in timeline, you can zoom in the timeline or preview it in the Preview window to check if it needs any order adjustment or deletion.

#### 3 Adjust Photo Duration to Create Time lapse Video

Select one of the photos in the timeline and right click on it to select **Speed and Duration** to open the Custom Speed panel. Go to **Duration** section, and change the duration of the photo to 00:00:00:01 or other duration based on your needs, and then click **OK**.

You can also add a background music to make time lapse more professional. You can choose a music sound from the built-in music library or import your own audio file.

#### 4 Export your new video

Place the timeline playhead at the beginner, and play it in Preview window to check the time lapse effects. If everything works fine, click the **Export** tab and choose the target format and click **SETTINGS** to output the time lapse video. Here you can change the video format and video and audio parameters such as Bit Rate, Encoder, Resolution and so on.

If you want to save and play your video on iPhone, iPod, iPad and other devices, just switch to the **Device** tab and choose from the device list. What’s more, you can upload the newly made video file to all popular video sites such as YouTube and Vimeo directly from the interface of Filmora. Or turn to **DVD** tab to burn your video to DVD for playing on TV.

## Method 2: Speed Up to Make a Time lapse Video

In case that you want to make a time lapse video with video footage, below are the step-by-step tutorial:

#### 1 Import Video Footage

Just like importing photos to Filmora, follow the steps to import the video clips to media library.

#### 2 Cut out part of the video for time lapse editing (optional)

Next, drag your video onto the video column in the timeline. Select the loaded video and click the "Play" button. While playing the video, drag the slider bar at the start time and hit the "Split" icon to cut out the part you want to do time lapse editing.

#### 3 Speed up to create time lapse video

Right click on the video clip in the timeline to select **Speed and Duration**. Then a window will pop up for you to adjust the settings of video. Find the **Speed** option and drag the slider bar to the right to increase the speed. If you set the playback speed to play at 200% the original speed, then the 30-second clip be only 15 seconds (twice the speed). After that click **OK**. Click the **Play** button to preview the result. Filmora now support up to 100x fast mo and 0.01x slow mo.
