 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

All types of vistas change as time passes. Consequently, an outdoor scene looks differently throughout different parts of the day, which makes it impossible to capture the full extent of its beauty by snapping a single photo or recording a short video of it.

That is why you must utilize the **time-lapse technique** to depict the passage of time at a particular shooting location and create a sequence in your video that suggests that a certain amount of time has passed by. So in this article, we will take you through some of the **best time-lapse video editing software** you can find on the market in 2024.

## Best Time-Lapse Video Post-Production Software in 2024

There are two different recording methods you can use to create time-lapse videos. You can either **record videos or take photos at a precisely set interval**, but regardless of the approach you choose, you must have the right equipment for the job.

This means that you must have a time-lapse tripod that ensures the smooth movement of your camera, an intervalometer, and a camera setup capable of taking pictures or recording videos over an extended period of time.

Most importantly, you must have access to a [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that enables you to process the footage and control its playback rate. Let's take a look at the best post-production software products that allow its users to create stunning time-lapses video.

#### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/): Best Time-lapse Software for Beginners \[Windows & Mac\]

**Price:**  Freemium

**Compatibility:**  Windows, macOS

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Mac and PC users can create time-lapse videos with Filmora effortlessly, even though the actual steps you will need to take throughout the process depend on the type of footage you're using to create a time-lapse. If you decide to make a time-lapse out of still images, you must ensure that you have enough footage since the video you're producing must have 24 or 30 frames per second. That's why you need **30 or 24 photos** for each second of your time-lapse video, and you must arrange all of these images on the editor's timeline before you begin adjusting their duration.

![ Filmora Timelapse video making](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-timelapse-video-from-photos-in-filmora-1.jpg)

Select all timeline photos placed in the timeline panel, right-click to access the   **Duration setting**, and then **set the input duration of each picture to 0.01 seconds**.

Click OK to continue, and you'll find that the duration of all timelapse photos has changed to a brief second. Click the playback button in the Preview window, and you'll see the time-lapse video is made already.

![ made  Timelapse video with Filmora ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-make-timelapse-video-with-photos-1.jpg)

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you are working with video files, you should **double the playback rate** to create the time-lapse effect. The results you will get largely depend on the quality of the footage you've recorded. You must do everything in your power to capture the photos or videos properly before you start the video editing process.

#### 2. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/): Best Free Time-lapse Software for Mac

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  macOS and iOS

iMovie may not be the most advanced video editing software for Mac computers, but that doesn't mean that you can't use iMovie to create time-lapse videos. In fact, all you have to do to make a time-lapse video with this software is to arrange the photos on the editor's timeline and change their duration to **0.1** seconds from the **Clip Information panel**.

However, if you do this, your time-lapse video will play only **10 frames per second**, so to [speed it up](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you first have to export the video you've created in this manner and then import it back into iMovie.

Afterward, you can select the **Custom option** from the **Speed menu** that lets you select the playback speed of a video clip. Making a time-lapse video in iMovie is a slow process that requires a lot of patience, especially if you are working with a large number of photos or video clips.

If you want to edit videos further with iMovie, here is a brief tutorial about [How to Use iMovie to Edit Videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 3. [VirtualDub](http://www.virtualdub.org/): Free Time-lapse Video Editor for Windows

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  Windows

This open-source video editor is commonly used for batch-processing of **AVI video files** and sets of **BMP image files**. Even though VirtualDub doesn't offer a lot of video editing tools, its batch-processing capabilities make it a perfect choice for all PC users who want to create time-lapse videos.

Nonetheless, the process of making a time-lapse in VirtualDub is highly technical as you'll need to make sure that all the images you want to use in the video are the **same size**. Besides, you'll have to set up the **video's [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and compression manually**, before you can apply it to all files you imported into the video editor. That's why you first need to familiarize yourself with VirtualDub and then start using it to make time-lapse videos.

#### 4. [GoPro Quik](https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/softwareandapp/quik-%7C-desktop/Quik-Desktop.html) : Best Video Editor for Creating Time-Lapse Photos Shot With GoPro

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  macOS, Windows

GoPro cameras offer a plethora of ways to capture the footage you can later turn into time-lapse videos. Besides a GoPro camera, you will also need additional equipment like **rotating camera mounts, extra batteries, or several memory cards** to record the time-lapse footage properly.

GoPro's Quik video editor features all the tools you're going to need to organize large quantities of video and photo files and create time-lapse videos. The software also enables you to add **panning effects** to your time-lapses that simulate the camera movement. However, GoPro Quik is a good choice only for filmmakers and video content creators who record most of their footage with different models of GoPro cameras.

#### 5. [Final Cut Pro X](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12) : Best Professional Video Editing Software for Time-lapse Video on Mac

**Price:**  $299.99

**Compatibility:**  macOS

Controlling the playback speed of the files you import into a project in FCPX is simple, since you just have to place the photos or videos on the timeline and select them. Afterward, you should head over to the **Retime** submenu that is located in the **Modify drop-down menu** and select one of the **Custom Speed, Blade Speed or Fast** options.

You will have to tweak the particular settings depending on the option you select, but your main goal should be to speed up the footage just enough to suggest the rapid passage of time. Try out different values to find the playback speed that is best suited for the time-lapse video you're working on.

#### 6. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) : Best Professional Video Editing Software for Time-lapse Video on Windows

**Price:**  $20.99 per month as a single app

**Compatibility:**  Windows, macOS

The way you capture your photos and organize them is crucial in creating a time-lapse video in Adobe Premiere Pro. You must **arrange all the photos numerically**, and once you're ready to import them into the software, you must make sure that the **Image Sequence checkbox** is selected. Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically generate a video from the photos so you can add a video file to the timeline instead of hundreds of still images. This professional video editing software provides with a broad range of video editing tools you can use to **simulate camera movement, perform color correction or control the video's playback speed**. The process of creating a time-lapse video with Adobe Premiere Pro isn't complicated, but you must be prepared for each step of this process if you want to go through it smoothly.

#### 7. [LRTimelapse](https://lrtimelapse.com/)

**Price:**  Free trial available, subscription plans start at $99.00

**Compatibility:**  macOS, Windows

The time-lapse photos you take with your camera must be edited before you can turn them into a video. LRTimelapse software is designed to reduce the amount of time you have to spend editing the footage. It allows you to process each image in [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) and then import those edits into the project you created in LRTimelapse. Furthermore, this app for PC and Mac computers lets you **fade in and fade out time lapses, adjust the white balance throughout the sequence you're creating, or get rid of the unwanted flickering effect**. LRTimelapse allows you to export videos in resolutions up to 8K, making it a perfect choice for all filmmakers and photographers in need of powerful time-lapse post-production software.

**Conclusion**

Preparation is the most important segment of the time-lapse video production process.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

All types of vistas change as time passes. Consequently, an outdoor scene looks differently throughout different parts of the day, which makes it impossible to capture the full extent of its beauty by snapping a single photo or recording a short video of it.

That is why you must utilize the **time-lapse technique** to depict the passage of time at a particular shooting location and create a sequence in your video that suggests that a certain amount of time has passed by. So in this article, we will take you through some of the **best time-lapse video editing software** you can find on the market in 2024.

## Best Time-Lapse Video Post-Production Software in 2024

There are two different recording methods you can use to create time-lapse videos. You can either **record videos or take photos at a precisely set interval**, but regardless of the approach you choose, you must have the right equipment for the job.

This means that you must have a time-lapse tripod that ensures the smooth movement of your camera, an intervalometer, and a camera setup capable of taking pictures or recording videos over an extended period of time.

Most importantly, you must have access to a [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that enables you to process the footage and control its playback rate. Let's take a look at the best post-production software products that allow its users to create stunning time-lapses video.

#### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/): Best Time-lapse Software for Beginners \[Windows & Mac\]

**Price:**  Freemium

**Compatibility:**  Windows, macOS

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Mac and PC users can create time-lapse videos with Filmora effortlessly, even though the actual steps you will need to take throughout the process depend on the type of footage you're using to create a time-lapse. If you decide to make a time-lapse out of still images, you must ensure that you have enough footage since the video you're producing must have 24 or 30 frames per second. That's why you need **30 or 24 photos** for each second of your time-lapse video, and you must arrange all of these images on the editor's timeline before you begin adjusting their duration.

![ Filmora Timelapse video making](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-timelapse-video-from-photos-in-filmora-1.jpg)

Select all timeline photos placed in the timeline panel, right-click to access the   **Duration setting**, and then **set the input duration of each picture to 0.01 seconds**.

Click OK to continue, and you'll find that the duration of all timelapse photos has changed to a brief second. Click the playback button in the Preview window, and you'll see the time-lapse video is made already.

![ made  Timelapse video with Filmora ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-make-timelapse-video-with-photos-1.jpg)

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you are working with video files, you should **double the playback rate** to create the time-lapse effect. The results you will get largely depend on the quality of the footage you've recorded. You must do everything in your power to capture the photos or videos properly before you start the video editing process.

You can check the details about two ways of [making a time-lapse video in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) here.

#### 2. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/): Best Free Time-lapse Software for Mac

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  macOS and iOS

iMovie may not be the most advanced video editing software for Mac computers, but that doesn't mean that you can't use iMovie to create time-lapse videos. In fact, all you have to do to make a time-lapse video with this software is to arrange the photos on the editor's timeline and change their duration to **0.1** seconds from the **Clip Information panel**.

However, if you do this, your time-lapse video will play only **10 frames per second**, so to [speed it up](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you first have to export the video you've created in this manner and then import it back into iMovie.

Afterward, you can select the **Custom option** from the **Speed menu** that lets you select the playback speed of a video clip. Making a time-lapse video in iMovie is a slow process that requires a lot of patience, especially if you are working with a large number of photos or video clips.

If you want to edit videos further with iMovie, here is a brief tutorial about [How to Use iMovie to Edit Videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 3. [VirtualDub](http://www.virtualdub.org/): Free Time-lapse Video Editor for Windows

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  Windows

This open-source video editor is commonly used for batch-processing of **AVI video files** and sets of **BMP image files**. Even though VirtualDub doesn't offer a lot of video editing tools, its batch-processing capabilities make it a perfect choice for all PC users who want to create time-lapse videos.

Nonetheless, the process of making a time-lapse in VirtualDub is highly technical as you'll need to make sure that all the images you want to use in the video are the **same size**. Besides, you'll have to set up the **video's [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and compression manually**, before you can apply it to all files you imported into the video editor. That's why you first need to familiarize yourself with VirtualDub and then start using it to make time-lapse videos.

#### 4. [GoPro Quik](https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/softwareandapp/quik-%7C-desktop/Quik-Desktop.html) : Best Video Editor for Creating Time-Lapse Photos Shot With GoPro

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  macOS, Windows

GoPro cameras offer a plethora of ways to capture the footage you can later turn into time-lapse videos. Besides a GoPro camera, you will also need additional equipment like **rotating camera mounts, extra batteries, or several memory cards** to record the time-lapse footage properly.

GoPro's Quik video editor features all the tools you're going to need to organize large quantities of video and photo files and create time-lapse videos. The software also enables you to add **panning effects** to your time-lapses that simulate the camera movement. However, GoPro Quik is a good choice only for filmmakers and video content creators who record most of their footage with different models of GoPro cameras.

### 03**Instasaved**

**Price**: FREE

With our next pick, we spice it up with an Instagram-specific tool, called Instasave that you can use to download pretty much any kind of Instagram content that you want.

**Price**: Free

Next on our list is OFFMP3\. It is, much like the other tools we've introduced thus far, an online video converter tool! This one, however, just like Intasaved, is a lot more obscure than the first two that we introduced. And thus, a little more limited.

| Features                                                                  | Limits                                                                    |

### 05**4ins**

**Price**: FREE

Despite the name, 4in's Instagram to MP4 converter does work for converting Instagram posts into MP3 files as well (as is shown in the image below). It's not the most advanced converter tool out there. But it does work, and it requires no download or installation.

| Features                                                                                                                 | Limits                                                                  |

The cameras on iPhones and Android phones enable us to capture high-resolution footage with a single tap, but the videos we record with our Smartphones are not always perfect. **Vertical video editing apps** provide a simple solution to these issues, as they allow their users to edit their footage just moments after they recorded it.

The ease of use, the number of available video editing options, or the ease of use are some of the aspects we considered while choosing the vertical video app we included in this article. So, let’s take a look at what the best vertical video apps for iOS and Android devices have to offer.

## The Best Vertical Video Apps for iOS and Android Devices

Being able to post content to your social media pages from wherever you go can help you attract a large number of followers.

Here are some of the **best vertical video apps** you can find on Google Play or App Store.

Note: The vertical editing apps are listed in no particular order.

You can combine up to 75 videos and photos, and Quik will analyze them automatically and apply corrections wherever it is needed.

The app also grants you access to more than twenty themes that contain transitions and graphics, so that you can just upload the footage you want to include in a project and Quik will do the rest for you. Each of these themes is fully customizable and you can easily trim a video clip, [alter its playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or set a preferred aspect ratio.

**What We Love About Quik:**

The app’s video editing options are as impressive as its video recording capabilities, since cutting, trimming or merging videos and photos requires a minimum amount of effort.

There are more than fifty video filters available in the app’s effects library while [adding a text overlay to a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) requires only a few taps.

**Frequently Asked Questions About Vertical Video Apps for iOS And Android Devices**

**1\. How to edit a vertical video?**

Editing a vertical video is not much different than editing a horizontal video, as you need to remove the parts of the footage you don’t want to include in your project, enhance the colors in a video or add transitions between shots.

**2\. How to change the video’s orientation from horizontal to vertical in iMovie?**

Rotating a video in iMovie is a simple task that can be completed with a single tap. You just have to select a clip you want to rotate on the timeline and then go to the Crop window and rotate your video for 90-degrees.
