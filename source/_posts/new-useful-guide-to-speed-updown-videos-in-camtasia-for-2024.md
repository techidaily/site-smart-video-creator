Now, for the promised list of **Instagram Video Converter (MP3)** tools! This list will be as comprehensive as we can manage it, including not only an introduction but also the pricing, features, and limitations of all the converters in question.

### 01**INSTAGRAM VIDEO CONVERTER**

**Price**: FREE

The Instagram Video Converter offered on the 'Online Video Converter' website is the first **Insta MP3 converter** on this list! It's incredibly easy to use, and is free to boot! So, you can **convert MP3 Instagram** audio with no problem. Keep in mind, of course, that because this tool is free, it does come with its limits as well as general cons.

| Features                                                                                                                  | Limits                                                                                                                              |

![Instagram Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-5.png)

### 02**Ace Thinker**

**Price**: FREE

Our next **Instagram Video Converter (MP3)** is Ace Thinker. Just like the one from 'Online Video Converter' this is an online solution that you can use on any device (be it your smartphone or Windows/Mac computer). It's also 100% free, so you can use it without having to worry about making any long-term commitments.

| Features                                                                       | Limits                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

![Ace Thinker - Free Instagram to MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-6.png)

### 03**Instasaved**

**Price**: FREE

With our next pick, we spice it up with an Instagram-specific tool, called Instasave that you can use to download pretty much any kind of Instagram content that you want. That, of course, includes allowing you to **convert MP3 Instagram** posts! Note, however, this is not as well-known as other options out there, so use it mindfully!

| Features                                                                                                                         | Limits                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Instagram content downloader ● Multiple file format converter ● Online video converter - no download or installation required. | ● Conversion tool only ● No quality control ● Can only be used when online |

![Instasaved - Anonymous Instagram Video Downloaderr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-7.png)

### 04**OffMP3**

**Price**: Free

Next on our list is OFFMP3\. It is, much like the other tools we've introduced thus far, an online video converter tool! This one, however, just like Intasaved, is a lot more obscure than the first two that we introduced. And thus, a little more limited.

| Features                                                                  | Limits                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Online video converter ● FREE-to-use ● Multiple video conversion format | ● For online use only ● Obscure site ● Comes with potentially harmful ads |

![OffMP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-8.png)

### 05**4ins**

**Price**: FREE

Despite the name, 4in's Instagram to MP4 converter does work for converting Instagram posts into MP3 files as well (as is shown in the image below). It's not the most advanced converter tool out there. But it does work, and it requires no download or installation.

| Features                                                                                                                 | Limits                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Free to use ● Online video converter, no download or installation needed ● Available conversion formats: .mp4 and .mp3 | ● For online use only ● Limited conversion formats ● No quality control |

## Unlock FCP X's Power: Adding Effects in Just 3 Steps

# Simple Guide to FCP X: How To Add Effects in 3 Steps

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

There are two broad categories of effects in Final Cut Pro X: Inspector effects and Effects Browser effects.

I've written previously about how to use Inspector effects to create a [picture-in-picture](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effect, among many other effects available to us in Final Cut Pro. In this article, I want to show you how to apply an effect to a clip, modify that effect, temporarily turn that effect on or off, or delete it entirely.

---

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Apply Effects to Video in Final Cut Pro X

* [Find and apply an effect](#part1)
* [Modify an effect](#part2)
* [Disable and delete an effect](#part3)
* [Extra credit](#part4)

#### Find and apply an effect

Here is our clip - a fearsome polar bear.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx001.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To apply an effect, first select the clip in the Timeline.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx002.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Then, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Effects Browser (or type Cmd + 5).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx003.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The Browser, like all the effects browsers, lists categories of effects on the left, a search box at the bottom to use for searching for the names of effects, and effects for each category on the right.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx004.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Here, for example, I've selected the Blur category, with my cursor near the Gaussian blur effect. (Gaussian blur is the best effect to use when you want a clip to look blurry.)

To apply an effect, do one of two things:

* Drag the effect from the Browser onto the clip you want to change.
* If the clip, or clips, are selected, double-click the effect in the Browser to apply it.

#### Modify an effect

To modify an effect, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Inspector (or type Cmd + 4).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx005.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Click the Video tab in the Inspector. Effects from the Effects Browser are always listed at the top of the Inspector.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx006.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Grab a slider and drag it to see what happens. For example, to make an image blurrier, drag the Amount slider to the right. To lessen the effect, drag it to the left.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx007.jpg "add effects in fcp")

#### Disable and delete an effect

To temporarily disable an effect, without deleting it, click the blue box so that it turns gray.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx008.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To enable an effect, click the gray box so it turns blue again.

To delete an effect, click the name of the effect - in this example: Gaussian - and press the big Delete key.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx009.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The effect will be deleted from the selected clip.

#### Extra credit

You can apply, modify, even delete the same effect to multiple clips by first selecting all the clips you want to change in the Timeline then adding, changing the settings, or deleting an effect in the Inspector.

#### Summary

The process of applying effects is the same for all effects you apply from the Effects Browser. In future articles I'll show you how to use this technique to create a wide variety of different effects in Final Cut Pro X.

You can apply, modify, even delete the same effect to multiple clips by first selecting all the clips you want to change in the Timeline then adding, changing the settings, or deleting an effect in the Inspector.

#### Summary

The process of applying effects is the same for all effects you apply from the Effects Browser. In future articles I'll show you how to use this technique to create a wide variety of different effects in Final Cut Pro X.
