![ Create Stop Motion with Captured Photos  - create project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-project-in-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Once the Animation window loads, you will be able to see the timeline below the preview window that shows everything your web camera can see. After you composed your shot, you should simply click on the Camera button that is located on the right side of the screen, then move the object that is in the shot and click on the camera button again. You should repeat this process as many times as necessary until you have captured all the frames you want to include in your stop motion animation.

![ Capture Photos in  Cloud Stop Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-photos-with-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

In case you want to alter the frame rate, you can click on the Project Settings icon that is located at the top of the toolbar in the upper left corner of the screen.

![ Cloud Stop Motion Project Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-project-settings.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Make Stop Motion Videos from Videos Online

In case you don’t have the photos you can use to create a stop motion animation, platforms like Kapwing allow you to turn a regular video into a stop motion video. All you need to do is upload a video clip from your computer or via a URL to Kapwing and the platform will automatically generate a stop motion video. One of the best part is that Kapwing also provides a sample if you don’t want to upload your own footage.

![    Import footage to Kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-stop-motion-footage-in-kapwing.jpg)

![ kapwing stop motion maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker.jpg)

While adjusting these settings you should keep in mind that lowering a [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too much can result in choppy footage and uneven movement of the objects in the stop motion video you’re creating.

Kapwing also offers the option to [play the video in reverse](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but finding the right context to use this feature can prove to be a challenging task. Click on the Create button when ready to export the stop motion video and wait for the platform to generate the video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)

Afterward, you can choose to download, edit or share the video on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. In case you created a stop motion video while you were logged out of your Kapwing account, the platform will add a watermark to it, and you must sign in to [remove](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it.
