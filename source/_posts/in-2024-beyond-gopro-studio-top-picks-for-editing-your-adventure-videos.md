## Bonus! Remove watermark from your videos

Removing a watermark isn’t bad, especially when you put in a lot of effort to create and edit the video. Watermarking means that the person using or handling the video is not the rightful owner; this is possible with the help of tags or logos. Luckily, there are simple ways to help remove watermarks from any video. However, some of this software is easy to use; you to edit the video file before uploading it to YouTube or any platform of your choice. Below are two simple steps to remove a watermark from a video:

### 1\. Remove Watermark with the Crop tool

This method will entirely remove the watermark from your movie, but it will also crop out a portion of the video that contains the watermark. It might not work well with all video options, so you might lose some vital parts of the video frame. However, you can use Wondershare Filmora software to crop out the edges containing the watermark.

By this, import your video, right-click on the timeline, zoom the video and click on “crop” to manually trim the edges to your chosen size or use the automatic option to select a ratio. Now adjust the edges of the cropping box to remove the watermark. You’ve successfully erased a watermark from your movie by clicking OK to apply the cropping effect.

However, one of the setbacks is that you will have to cut out some parts of the video, and it does not work if the watermark is in any other position other than the corners.

### 2\. Apowersoft Website

Apowersoft is a web-based platform that allows you to remove watermark from video clips and images in very few steps. Other features available on the website include file compressor, Movie edition, video producer, and many more. However, below is a guide on using Apowersoft to remove watermarks from your video.

* Go to apowersoft.com in your browser. Then click on “Products & Solution” to choose from the Video Editor tab of the Online section.
* To remove the watermark, search and click on it.
* You can now upload the video to the website. After that, click the preview button to see a video preview, and then click the Add Box button to select a watermark for the video.
* Click on the “Erase button” to crop out the watermark section.
* Finally, download it to your PC.

## Conclusion

● Finding a video trimmer without a watermark can be difficult, and the truth is, having watermarks on your video makes it unprofessional. Though it might be for fun or personal use, why leave the watermarks when you can trim them off with a few clicks. There are many video trimmers out there, but the ones listed in this article will help you trim videos without watermark and, most importantly, without really losing the original texture of the clip. Therefore, you can check them out to see what works for you.

## Part 1 **6 Best Free MP3 Converter for Windows 10 / 11**

As promised, we start this off with the best **audio converter** (**Windows 10**/11) tools. We've decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE **MP3 Converters** (**Windows**), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter's interface looks like.

### 01**EaseUs MobiMover**

EaseUs MobiMover is an **audio converter for Windows 10** and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It's a FREEmium software though — which means that it's use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.

![EaseUs MobiMover - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%201.png)

### 02**Freemake Video Converter**

Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE **MP3 converter for Windows 10** on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It's a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)

![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%202.png)

### 03**VSDC**

Much like Freemake, our next **MP3 converter for Windows 10** and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it's not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an **audio-video-converter for Windows 10** (and vice versa.)

![VSDC - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%203.png)

### 04**Convertio.co**

With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!

![Convertio - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%204.png)

### 05**Free Convert**

Free Convert is another online **MP3 convert for Windows 10** users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you'll have to pay for the premium version.

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

![DVDVideoSoft](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%206.png)

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.)

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!)

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

As far as audio-editing goes, you're probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Beginner-friendly audio editor

**●** Simple, clean interface

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below).

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Operating System: Windows

### 06**Audiotool**

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** There are multiple **MP3 converters for Windows** and Mac that you can use in order to convert videos to an audio file that you can use for certain projects.

**●** Of course, if you want your finished project to sound clean, you'll probably need a functional audio editor for that! And, for this matter, we recommend advanced video editing software like Filmora Pro.

**●** Just in case you want to review what your converted audio sounds like, consider one of the audio players that are available for Windows and Mac!

**●** If you find that your audio needs some trimming, a quick trim with an audio cutter should do the trick. It's very simple to do!

We've also included a list of the best MP3 editor Windows & Mac, and a list for the **best MP3 player Windows** & Mac! There's even a quick tutorial in the end that can help you **trim MP3 (Windows)** files that you've converted so that you can more cleanly include it in your own project.

04 [How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **6 Best Free MP3 Converter for Windows 10 / 11**

As promised, we start this off with the best **audio converter** (**Windows 10**/11) tools. We've decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE **MP3 Converters** (**Windows**), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter's interface looks like.

### 01**EaseUs MobiMover**

EaseUs MobiMover is an **audio converter for Windows 10** and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It's a FREEmium software though — which means that it's use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.

![EaseUs MobiMover - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%201.png)

### 02**Freemake Video Converter**

Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE **MP3 converter for Windows 10** on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It's a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)

![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%202.png)

### 03**VSDC**

Much like Freemake, our next **MP3 converter for Windows 10** and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it's not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an **audio-video-converter for Windows 10** (and vice versa.)

![VSDC - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%203.png)

### 04**Convertio.co**

With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!

![Convertio - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%204.png)

### 05**Free Convert**

Free Convert is another online **MP3 convert for Windows 10** users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you'll have to pay for the premium version.

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

![DVDVideoSoft](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%206.png)

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.) This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we'll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.

### 01**Wondershare Filmora**

Operating System: Windows/Mac

Today's Best Deals: US$89.99 (one-time)

The first on our list is the **MP3 editor Windows 10** and Mac compatible, [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) This is an advanced video editing software that you can use in order to work on just about any digital project — including, of course, editing your MP3 audio files.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Lots of editing tools for MP3 files

**●** Exports high-quality end-products

**●** FREE to try, multiple-packages available

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Premium software (subscription/one-time fee)

**●** Download and installation is required

![Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%207.png)

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

**●** Difficult to use for beginners

![Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%208.png)

### 03**Ashampoo Music Studio 8**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: US$29.99

Next up is Ashampoo's Music Studio 8! Here's another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it's the tool that you're looking for, but you'll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it's quite the effective **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** (among other things). So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

**●** One-time fee only

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Freemium software (one-time payment required)

**●** Available only for Windows!

**●** Cannot support multiple tracks

![Convertio - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%204.png)

### 05**Free Convert**

Free Convert is another online **MP3 convert for Windows 10** users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you'll have to pay for the premium version.

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.) This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we'll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.

### 01**Wondershare Filmora**

Operating System: Windows/Mac

Today's Best Deals: US$89.99 (one-time)

The first on our list is the **MP3 editor Windows 10** and Mac compatible, [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) This is an advanced video editing software that you can use in order to work on just about any digital project — including, of course, editing your MP3 audio files.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Lots of editing tools for MP3 files

**●** Exports high-quality end-products

**●** FREE to try, multiple-packages available

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Premium software (subscription/one-time fee)

**●** Advanced tools might make it harder to get used to

**●** Download and installation is required

![Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%207.png)

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

**●** Difficult to use for beginners

![Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%208.png)

### 03**Ashampoo Music Studio 8**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: US$29.99

Next up is Ashampoo's Music Studio 8! Here's another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it's the tool that you're looking for, but you'll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it's quite the effective **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** (among other things). So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

**●** One-time fee only

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Freemium software (one-time payment required)

**●** Available only for Windows!

**●** Cannot support multiple tracks

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%209.png)

### 04**Ocenaudio**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

As far as audio-editing goes, you're probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that's all you're looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Beginner-friendly audio editor

**●** Simple, clean interface

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older software

**●** Open-source, not updated as often

**●** Only an audio-editing software

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2010.png)

### 05**Acoustica**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Our next pick is another open-source, **MP3 editor for Windows 10**. It's called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it's a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source product

**●** Advanced audio editing tools

**●** Advanced exporting formats

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older version of the software

**●** Updated version is PAID

**●** Available only for Windows

![Acoustica](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2011.png)

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn't mean that it won't work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux users

**●** Advanced audio editing

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Complex editing interface

**●** Requires internet to work (Linux)

**●** Not regularly updated

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)

**●** There are multiple **MP3 converters for Windows** and Mac that you can use in order to convert videos to an audio file that you can use for certain projects.
