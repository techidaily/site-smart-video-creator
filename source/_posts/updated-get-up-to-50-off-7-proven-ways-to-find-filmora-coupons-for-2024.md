##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The cameras on iPhones and Android phones enable us to capture high-resolution footage with a single tap, but the videos we record with our Smartphones are not always perfect. **Vertical video editing apps** provide a simple solution to these issues, as they allow their users to edit their footage just moments after they recorded it.

The ease of use, the number of available video editing options, or the ease of use are some of the aspects we considered while choosing the vertical video app we included in this article. So, let’s take a look at what the best vertical video apps for iOS and Android devices have to offer.

---

Here are some of the **best vertical video apps** you can find on Google Play or App Store.

Note: The vertical editing apps are listed in no particular order.

### 1. [Quik](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/quik-app-video-photo-editor)

You can combine up to 75 videos and photos, and Quik will analyze them automatically and apply corrections wherever it is needed.

The app also grants you access to more than twenty themes that contain transitions and graphics, so that you can just upload the footage you want to include in a project and Quik will do the rest for you. Each of these themes is fully customizable and you can easily trim a video clip, [alter its playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or set a preferred aspect ratio.

**1\. How to edit a vertical video?**

Editing a vertical video is not much different than editing a horizontal video, as you need to remove the parts of the footage you don’t want to include in your project, enhance the colors in a video or add transitions between shots.

**2\. How to change the video’s orientation from horizontal to vertical in iMovie?**

Rotating a video in iMovie is a simple task that can be completed with a single tap. You just have to select a clip you want to rotate on the timeline and then go to the Crop window and rotate your video for 90-degrees.

#### **Conclusion**

Finding a video editing app that is compatible with the iOS or Android operating system that allows you to create vertical videos shouldn’t be too difficult, as there are so many different options on the market. What’s more, some of the vertical video apps can also be used to capture the footage you want to share on social media.

Editing a vertical video is not much different than editing a horizontal video, as you need to remove the parts of the footage you don’t want to include in your project, enhance the colors in a video or add transitions between shots.

**2\. How to change the video’s orientation from horizontal to vertical in iMovie?**

Rotating a video in iMovie is a simple task that can be completed with a single tap. You just have to select a clip you want to rotate on the timeline and then go to the Crop window and rotate your video for 90-degrees.

---

#### **Conclusion**

Finding a video editing app that is compatible with the iOS or Android operating system that allows you to create vertical videos shouldn’t be too difficult, as there are so many different options on the market. What’s more, some of the vertical video apps can also be used to capture the footage you want to share on social media.
