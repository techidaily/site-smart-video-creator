#### 2 Add cool effects to your video

Now it's time to add cool effects to your video. Just drop the video and audio files from the media library to the corresponding timelines. Then click the “Effect” button in the toolbar to switch to the “Effect” tab. Here you will see filters and overlays effects for you to choose.

To add transitions between two clips, or add an overlay or filter video effect to video, just go to the corresponding tab and drag and drop the target video effects to videos.

You can also right click your favorite effect and select apply. You will see the “Effect” Timeline appear below the video track. If you want to increase the effect duration, just mouse over the edge of the effect in timeline, and when the "double arrow" cursor appears, drag it to any length you want.

Detailed information about how to add a split-screen effect video, check our [guide about how to make a split screen video here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 3 Export your videos

You can preview and watch your video by clicking the “Play” button before you export it. Go back and make some necessary adjustments. Then you can save and export the video to your computer in the “Format” tab. If you want to play video on mobile devices, go to the “Devices” tab and choose a device from the list. Of course, you can also directly burn it to DVD or post on YouTube or Vimeo.

Besides adding cool video effects to video clips, you can also reverse, speed up or slow down the video to make a cool effect. You can also choose music sound from the built in music library and do some audio editing with the Audio Mixer or Audio Equalizer tool.
