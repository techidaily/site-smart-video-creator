## Part 1 Key Facebook Cover Video Specifications

A Facebook cover video works like a mini-advertisement that is played on a loop continuously. To keep the visitors engaged and interested in the video, the video needs to look neat, clean, bright and in the right size and the aspect ratio to fit perfectly in the given space. Key specifications for the cover video are enlisted below.

**Video cover Facebook size**: As such, there are no specific size guidelines issues but it is recommended to keep the size of the video less than 1.75GB. The small size will ensure that users having slower browsing speed can also watch the video in a hassle-free manner.

Dimensions of the video: A video to be used as a cover should be at least 820 X 312 pixels and to get the optimum results it is suggested to keep it around 820 X 462 pixels. If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom. Thus, to ensure that the video looks perfect on a phone as well as desktop keep the aspect ratio at 16:9 and place the important text or other content at the center.

File type of the video: Videos in MP4 or MOV format are suggested to be used as the cover video and their resolution should be a maximum of 1080p.

Duration of the video: A Facebook cover video can be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds and you can also choose to play it on a loop.

## Part 1 Key Facebook Cover Video Specifications

A Facebook cover video works like a mini-advertisement that is played on a loop continuously. To keep the visitors engaged and interested in the video, the video needs to look neat, clean, bright and in the right size and the aspect ratio to fit perfectly in the given space. Key specifications for the cover video are enlisted below.

**Video cover Facebook size**: As such, there are no specific size guidelines issues but it is recommended to keep the size of the video less than 1.75GB. The small size will ensure that users having slower browsing speed can also watch the video in a hassle-free manner.

Dimensions of the video: A video to be used as a cover should be at least 820 X 312 pixels and to get the optimum results it is suggested to keep it around 820 X 462 pixels. If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom. Thus, to ensure that the video looks perfect on a phone as well as desktop keep the aspect ratio at 16:9 and place the important text or other content at the center.

File type of the video: Videos in MP4 or MOV format are suggested to be used as the cover video and their resolution should be a maximum of 1080p.

Duration of the video: A Facebook cover video can be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds and you can also choose to play it on a loop.

## Part 2 Useful Tips for a Wonderful Cover Video

To make sure that your cover video is interesting, engaging, and uploaded in a hassle-free manner, below listed are some useful tips

**●** Optimizing the video for the mobile phone users: Several times your video may run smoothly on your system but may have issues while playing on a mobile phone. So, keep your texts and important content within the specified size so that even if the video is cropped it does not look awkward.

**●** Go for prompt action: It is always better to get the CTA opportunities whenever available. When something specific is required from a video like increasing traffic, adding more clients, and similar others, let the video prompt to do that and avoid adding too much text.

**●** Audio is not very critical: Though audio can be added to the cover video, it does not have much relevance to the content you wish to showcase to the viewer. By default, the videos on Facebook are muted and also around 85% of the videos are watched without the sound.

**●** Keep the focus on one visual: A Facebook page is already too crowded and thus avoids loading the cover video with too much content. Focus on a single visual which can be text, image, CTA, or other depending on your purpose.

**●** Keep a natural loop: The video will be played on a loop continuously and thus to make it look appealing the starting and the ending should be smooth.

**●** Keeping the right size: Keeping the recommended **Facebook cover page video size** is important to make the video appear without any distortion, borders, or cropping.

## The Ultimate Battle: Adobe Premiere vs After Effects for Video Creators

# After Effects VS Adobe Premiere, 9 Differences Tell You Which One is Better?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

This is perhaps the most asked question regarding video processing on the internet. And looking at the product descriptions on the Adobe site gives us a clue why. There seems to be a large overlap between the two programs, and technically there is, although as we shall see capability doesn't always mean suitability, so the similarities are not quite as pronounced as they would appear.

With that in mind, it is worth looking at the key differences between [After Effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Premiere to get a clearer understanding of what is best for which situation and why you would pick one program over the other. So below are the 9 points that I will make a comparison.

#### Comparison Table

| After Effects                      | Adobe Premiere                            |                                     |

## After Effects VS Adobe Premiere

#### 1Timeline

There are numerous editing differences between the two programs, but we will start with the timeline as it perhaps best illustrates the different focus of each package. Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.

The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere's timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-1.png)

#### 2Editing

In addition to the timeline, Premiere has an interface and toolset built for precise editing and clip manipulation, both audio and video. This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.

This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-2.png)

#### 3Audio Mixer

In today's market the audio component on a video product can be as important as the visual aspects, the audio clip mixer within Premiere is a professional grade tool designed to offer precise control over a projects audio output and includes the ability to use VST3 industry standard plugins. Because After Effects is primarily a composite application it lacks the finesse of Premiere where audio is concerned. Again this shouldn't be read as being an inferior program, it simply has a different focus.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-3.jpg)

#### 4Mercury Playback Engine

In terms of perceived functionality probably not the top of the list, but Premiere uses this to employ either software (useful) or hardware (brilliant), assuming you have a compatible graphics card, accelerated real time renderless viewing of clips and sequences. This creates a much faster workflow for editing than is possible with After Effects beyond the previously mentioned tools and interface restrictions.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-4.jpg)

#### 5 Multicam

In terms of editing this is where After Effects just isn't comparable at all, the multi camera interface within Premiere is exceptionally featured and allows on the fly angle changes and edits and the ability to sync a single shot through numerous camera simultaneously. As said, the editing functionality on offer here is what Premiere exists for, and whilst both Premiere and After Effects are video manipulation packages, editing and composting are very different focuses, and the products reflect those differences.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-5.jpg)

#### 6Media Management

Often overlooked but very important for project fidelity, the media management facilities within Premiere are designed around the needs of editing production and enable a much easier organizational approach for large projects than that of After Effects.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-6.jpg)

#### 7Masking

This is where After Effects comes to the fore. The ability to create masks that track through scenes is a fundamental component of After Effects workflow and why it is so good for effects creation and compositing. None of these effects are readily achievable within Premiere as it ships, and even add ons will never achieve the fluidity and ease of use the purpose designed interface provides.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-7.jpg)

#### 8 Camera Tracker

The 3D camera tracker within After Effects is an incredibly useful tool designed to replicate the camera movements within a given scene to allow new layers to be added that precisely match the original scene, essential for composite work and simply not possible within Premiere.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-8.jpg)

#### 9 Effects

The collection of specific tools within After Effects for applying motion control effects, for color control, blurring shadows transitions and titles is vast, and whilst Premiere includes some of its own, it is clear that here After Effects has the edge and it once again highlights the different approach taken by each program. Premiere is primarily an editing application, it is designed to enable the fastest, most efficient and highest quality non-linear editing of a project possible. Within that framework it includes the ability, both natively and with plugins, to incorporate a limited range transitions and effects to aid the editing process.

After Effects, however, is an application built around effects, it is designed to allow an almost unlimited variety of effects, transitions and animations to be incorporated into a project via compositing and as such has a wealth of tools to enable the efficient workflow of those tasks, including some editing tools that would likely be needed for that job.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-9.png)

## Conclusion

I've seen it explained before in terms of Word and Excel. You can compose a letter in Excel and create a spreadsheet in Word with the tables functionality, but the end result will take much longer and never be quite as good doing it that way. This perhaps is the best way to explain the relationship between Premiere and After Effects.

Yes, a spec sheet makes the two programs seem somewhat comparable, but it is the focus of each application that shows why they differ so much. Ultimately, the best use of these programs is together, they complement each other perfectly.

## After Effects VS Adobe Premiere

#### 1Timeline

There are numerous editing differences between the two programs, but we will start with the timeline as it perhaps best illustrates the different focus of each package. Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.

The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere's timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-1.png)

#### 2Editing

In addition to the timeline, Premiere has an interface and toolset built for precise editing and clip manipulation, both audio and video. This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.

This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-2.png)

#### 3Audio Mixer

In today's market the audio component on a video product can be as important as the visual aspects, the audio clip mixer within Premiere is a professional grade tool designed to offer precise control over a projects audio output and includes the ability to use VST3 industry standard plugins. Because After Effects is primarily a composite application it lacks the finesse of Premiere where audio is concerned. Again this shouldn't be read as being an inferior program, it simply has a different focus.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-3.jpg)

#### 4Mercury Playback Engine

In terms of perceived functionality probably not the top of the list, but Premiere uses this to employ either software (useful) or hardware (brilliant), assuming you have a compatible graphics card, accelerated real time renderless viewing of clips and sequences. This creates a much faster workflow for editing than is possible with After Effects beyond the previously mentioned tools and interface restrictions.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-4.jpg)

#### 5 Multicam

In terms of editing this is where After Effects just isn't comparable at all, the multi camera interface within Premiere is exceptionally featured and allows on the fly angle changes and edits and the ability to sync a single shot through numerous camera simultaneously. As said, the editing functionality on offer here is what Premiere exists for, and whilst both Premiere and After Effects are video manipulation packages, editing and composting are very different focuses, and the products reflect those differences.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-5.jpg)

#### 6Media Management

Often overlooked but very important for project fidelity, the media management facilities within Premiere are designed around the needs of editing production and enable a much easier organizational approach for large projects than that of After Effects.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-6.jpg)

#### 7Masking

This is where After Effects comes to the fore. The ability to create masks that track through scenes is a fundamental component of After Effects workflow and why it is so good for effects creation and compositing. None of these effects are readily achievable within Premiere as it ships, and even add ons will never achieve the fluidity and ease of use the purpose designed interface provides.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-7.jpg)

#### 8 Camera Tracker

The 3D camera tracker within After Effects is an incredibly useful tool designed to replicate the camera movements within a given scene to allow new layers to be added that precisely match the original scene, essential for composite work and simply not possible within Premiere.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-8.jpg)

#### 9 Effects

The collection of specific tools within After Effects for applying motion control effects, for color control, blurring shadows transitions and titles is vast, and whilst Premiere includes some of its own, it is clear that here After Effects has the edge and it once again highlights the different approach taken by each program. Premiere is primarily an editing application, it is designed to enable the fastest, most efficient and highest quality non-linear editing of a project possible. Within that framework it includes the ability, both natively and with plugins, to incorporate a limited range transitions and effects to aid the editing process.

After Effects, however, is an application built around effects, it is designed to allow an almost unlimited variety of effects, transitions and animations to be incorporated into a project via compositing and as such has a wealth of tools to enable the efficient workflow of those tasks, including some editing tools that would likely be needed for that job.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-9.png)

## Conclusion

I've seen it explained before in terms of Word and Excel. You can compose a letter in Excel and create a spreadsheet in Word with the tables functionality, but the end result will take much longer and never be quite as good doing it that way. This perhaps is the best way to explain the relationship between Premiere and After Effects.

Yes, a spec sheet makes the two programs seem somewhat comparable, but it is the focus of each application that shows why they differ so much. Ultimately, the best use of these programs is together, they complement each other perfectly.

This is perhaps the most asked question regarding video processing on the internet. And looking at the product descriptions on the Adobe site gives us a clue why. There seems to be a large overlap between the two programs, and technically there is, although as we shall see capability doesn't always mean suitability, so the similarities are not quite as pronounced as they would appear.

With that in mind, it is worth looking at the key differences between [After Effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Premiere to get a clearer understanding of what is best for which situation and why you would pick one program over the other. So below are the 9 points that I will make a comparison.

 **Premiere Pro stabilize** is a powerful tool, but it also carries some limitations. Let's check them out!

**1\. Consider warp stabilize during shooting:**

If you keep in mind the warp stabilizer function while filming your videos or photos, you'll get rid of fixing problems after the work. So, if you want glossy touch in your shots with zero access to a gimbal, you should consider filming with a faster shutter speed or a wider frame. In this way, you'll get more convenience while applying the effect in the edit.

**2\. Modify extra cropping in your footage:**

Warp stabilizer is a tool that can provide you stable footage and crop your shot as well. It can crop out the edges of your photos or videos, giving you a smooth and clean shot. To adjust the cropping in your clips, go to advanced settings and then click on Crop less <-> Smooth More Slider.

**3\. Analyze the effect of Warp stabilizer:**

Always check the order of effects in the ''Effect Controls'' folder. If you ever lost some stabilization after editing your shot, ensure not to change the Warp Stabilizer analysis source. Further, you should always re-analyze your clip after a quick color fix.

**4\. Nest your clips:**

Sometimes we got an error message in the form of a red banner across our footage while trying to modify the speed on **premiere stabilize video**. Basically, we can't use a Warp stabilizer to alter the speed of the same clip. But no worries! There is an easy fix – click on the altered clip and then click on Nest. Now, you can fix the nested sequence without any trouble.

**5\. Save your favorite settings as a preset:**

If you've found a setting that gives you a happy result, you can save it as a preset for future use. In this way, you can speed up your work nicely while working with numerous shaky clips. Also, it can help if you want to make a similar effect to your multiple projects. Moreover, keep in mind that the Warp stabilizer needs to assess each clip frame by frame because it is not a one-size model that can fit all footage. Therefore, remember to click the ''Analyze'' button even after putting the preset to turn it on.

## Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?

Sometimes, the shakiness of clips is too extreme, and the Warp Stabilizer effect can't handle it. Moreover, the filter algorithm incorrectly compensates for the camera moves. So what strategy should apply in this condition? Luckily, there is a method that can be used to stabilize your clips without using a warp stabilizer. Moreover, this process can give a hyper-realistic effect to your footage!

**Step1:** Import your clip into Premiere Pro Project and add it to your timeline. Hit on the "clip", choose "Replace with After Effects Composition" to import the clip.

**Step 2:** Tap on the ''Tracker panel'' from the right side of the screen. Scroll down to the ''Track Motion'' option and open it.

**Step 3:** Pick the tracker marker, drag it to an area of contrasting subject and adjust it accordingly.

![adobe premiere pro track motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro-track-motion.jpg)

Tip: Remember not to make the outer box too large as After Effects can have a hard time performing the track.

**Step 4:** Hit the play button in the ''Tracker panel'' to initiate the After Effects. Create a new ''Null Object'' after the tracking process is complete.

**Step 5:** Move to the Tracker panel, click on "Edit Target," choose your "Null Object" and click "OK."

**Step 6:** Create a new camera and parent it to the null object for applying the stabilization effect to your clips. Enable the 3D option on both the footage layer and the null object.

**Step 7:** Extend your footage to compensate for any black bars that can occur as the camera pays for the shakiness. That's it!

**Conclusion:**

Shaky footage is almost inescapable once you go handheld. If you don't have a manual stabilizer like a gimbal, a tripod, or a glide cam – your work can fall victim to running, wind, walking, or other elements. In this article, we've introduced a quick and fast antidote for shaky footage – a Warp Stabilizer effect in the Adobe Premiere Pro.
