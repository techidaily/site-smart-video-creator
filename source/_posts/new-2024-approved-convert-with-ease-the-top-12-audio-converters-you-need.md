Most of the advanced camera units these days are capable enough to produce shots with rich quality automatically but still some professionals need to edit captured videos for little color correction. The major reasons behind this additional color correction are:

* Some people need to correct their mistakes on captured videos; it can be due to an incorrect balance of white and due to under or over-exposure at some points.
* Customize different video clips by matching them so that they appear in sequence even if they are captured at different moments.
* For creating a specific style or look in order to support your mood; for example, one may need to make scenes appear cold, dark, cheery, warm, bright or foreboding.

No matter what you want to do for the customization of your videos, Final Cut Pro can provide your complete assistance. The details below can help you to collect complete information about color correction techniques.

The steps below can help all beginners to develop easy video edited projects using Final Cut Pro, but if some of you find this platform a little difficult then it is good to start practicing as a beginner on [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Methods to Correct Color in Final Cut Pro

Those who wish to use FCP for color signal editing need to follow these steps:

#### Step 1

First you need to open **Color Board** on FCP as there is an automatic color correction tool available inside. The Video Board can be opened by using three different ways:

* You can select audio enhancement and color correction options available below the viewer and then hit “Show Color Board”. It can be simply done by pressing **CMD + 6**.

![Show Color Board”. ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-1.png)

* On effect browser you can easily access color correction effects inside the color category; that is also easier to allocate.

![Effect Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-2.png)

* Choose **Window** and then click on **Go To**, you will find **Color Board** on the appeared drop-down menu.

![Go to Color Board](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-3.png)

* All the color correction effects will start appearing in the effects section available on the video inspector.

![ Color correction effects on video inspector.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-4.png)

#### Step 2

As soon as you start working on **Color Board**, it is good to open Video Scopes on your system. For this you need to click on a small icon of light switch available at the top right corner of the viewer and then select Show Video Scopes from drop-down menu. It can be also done by simply pressing Command+7.

![ select Show Video Scopes from drop down menu.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-5.png)

As soon as you make this selection, the video scopes window will automatically appear on the next viewer. Here users can easily obtain information related to the current video frame, and they can be easily configured as per need. Go to the settings option available on the top right side of the window and then hit the **Waveform** option.

![ Go to settings option available at top right side of window and then hit Waveform option.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-6.png)

#### Step 3

Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:

**Exposure or Brightness:** On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.

![ Exposure or Brightness ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-7.png)

**Saturation:** It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.

![ Saturation ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-8.png)

**Hue:**  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need. Using the histogram option available on settings menu can help you to make direct adjustments for all these components.

![Hue ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-9.png)

#### Step 4

It is possible to preview all the corrections on the original image before making them final. Simple hit the arrow with left-facing formation in the top left corner of the Color Board and then return to the video inspector. Hit on the Blue box to switch between correction On and Off options.

* [**Part 2: Edit Video on Desktop with Filmora**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: FAQ**](#part3)

## Part 1: 5 Best Video Editing Apps for iPad

### 1\. Filmora (Recommended)

Available for iOS (i.e., for iPad) and Android users, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the most viable option if you want to take your videos to the next level from your mobile screens. The easy-to-use interface allows even the naivest users to adapt the video skills quickly plus it being easy-on-eyes also enables you to edit videos seamlessly. Given the dedicated options for everything — tripping & cutting videos to adding audio, photos, and subtitles — editing videos will not take time.

[![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/google_play.jpg) ](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) [![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/apple_store.jpg)](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6)

**Pros:**

* New upgrades have brought Advanced Crop features
* You can set duration of video motion
* Filmora includes all the basic video-editing features you might expect, like cutting, merging, cropping, and rotating video footage

**Cons:**

* Filmora does have a free version, but the video will be watermarked

**Price:**

**Free version available**

Filmora Pro (1 Year) — $32.99

Filmora Pro （1 Month） — $6.99

Remove Logo Roll — $4.99more

### 2\. LumaFusion (best for iPad)

Recommended for iPad users, LumaFusion is a multitrack mobile video editor used by professionals. However, unlike Filmora, LumaFusion does not make it simple for an average Joe to utilize the application to its full extent. In fact, LumaFusion recommends video tutorials if you are a beginner to video-editing. Nevertheless, when it comes to feature-set, LumaFusion has one of the most advanced libraries of features that allows you to tell compelling video stories.

**Pros:**

* Uncluttered, intuitive, and customizable user interface
* Advanced and adjustable image stabilizer
* Simple color correction — you do not have to fret with color wheels, video scopes, auto white balance, nodes, or any settings; instead, it includes a handful of color presets and sliders to make the process more convenient.
* Edit up to six layers of audio and video
* Supports all major video formats and more!

**Cons:**

* No android app available yet
* Not friendly for beginners
* No free version

**Price:** US$ 29.99, extra subscription for Storyblocks needed

### 3\. iMovie

Of course, how can we forget Apple’s native iMovie video editor? Yes, it lacks some bells and whistles, but it makes basic video editing a breeze. Suitable for beginners, iMovie's main aim is to provide ease of use in a clean and elegant interface. In all, you will not find advanced video-editing options. But when it comes to basic features like tripping, cutting, adding audio, subtitles, and transition effects — iMovie is second to no one in terms of usability.

**Pros:**

* Cross-platform apps for all Apple devices
* Features like the Trailer timeline make the whole process seamless
* Simple and easy-to-use interface — suitable for beginners
* Good range of fun templates
* Multiple audio-editing options
* Completely free to use

**Cons:**

* For the sake of simplicity, iMovie excludes some critical functions like motion-tracking and more.
* No advanced options like editing 360-degree video editing

**Price:** Free

### 4\. KineMaster

In the world where iPad Pro video editors rise and fall, KineMaster has survived all these years because of its powerful features and simplicity. Overall, if you are looking for a tool to edit videos on the go — you should take a serious look at KineMaster.

**Pros:**

* Includes advanced video editing options like Speed Control, Effects, Themes, Adjustments, Multiple Layers, Overlays, Music, Audio Filters, Frame-by-Frame Trimming, Volume Envelope, Stickers, and more!
* Straightforward interface and precise controls

**Cons:**

* Costly compared to the top competitors; especially, given the shy feature-set

**Price:**

* Premium Monthly — $7.99
* Premium Yearly — $35.99
* Legacy - Remove Watermark — $29.99
* Premium One-Time Purchase — $69.99

### 5\. Filmmaker Pro

Holding features like LUT effects, 4K capability, chroma key to add crazy 3D transitions, Filmmaker Pro is a viable option for any beginner learning how to edit videos.

**Pros:**

* Cross-platform support
* Multiple export options like YouTube
* Intuitive and simple interface

**Cons:**

* Subscription is compulsory if you want to remove the watermarks

**Price:**

* US$ 5.99 per month

## Part 2: Edit Video on Desktop with Filmora

## Part 3: FAQ

**Is the New M1 iPad Pro Good for Video Editing?**

Like most Apple products, the iPad Pro exterior hasn’t changed much compared to its predecessors, as the real magical upgrades are inside. The new M1 chip, the magnificent XDR display, 120Hz Refresh Rate, unbelievable Performance, Magic Keyboard, Thunderbolt 3, and USB 4 is enough to recognize the latest iPad Pro as the most powerful tablet ever made that can do everything that a Laptop can! Other hallmarks like the trackpad and magnetic slide — make it the perfect substitute for anyone looking to replace their laptop with an iPad Pro for video editing.

## Part4: Conclusion

Touch screens can be difficult to handle when performing precise operations like video-editing; that is why it is critical to use only the best video-editors on iPad.
