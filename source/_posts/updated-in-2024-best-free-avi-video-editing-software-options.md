Microsoft has released **Windows Live Movie Maker** on August 19, 2009 as part of a refresh to their Windows Live Essentials download. Windows Live Movie Maker is the first application designed for Windows 7 and is built to make beautiful movies from your photos and videos. And the latest version is **Windows Live Movie Maker 2011**.

**Update in 2017:** Microsoft has stopped the Windows Essentials Suite support on January 10, 2017\. It is claimed that it is no longer available for download. If you are looking for an alternative to windows essentials movie maker, or windows movie maker, try Filmora video editor, which is available on both Windows7, Windows8 and Windows 10.

In this article we will walk you through the best video editing software that's worth your money. Thus, scroll down to find the five best iPad Pro Video Editor of 2024\.

* [**Part 1: 5 Best Video Editing Apps for iPad**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Edit Video on Desktop with Filmora**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: FAQ**](#part3)

## Part 1: 5 Best Video Editing Apps for iPad

### 1\. Filmora (Recommended)

Available for iOS (i.e., for iPad) and Android users, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the most viable option if you want to take your videos to the next level from your mobile screens. The easy-to-use interface allows even the naivest users to adapt the video skills quickly plus it being easy-on-eyes also enables you to edit videos seamlessly. Given the dedicated options for everything — tripping & cutting videos to adding audio, photos, and subtitles — editing videos will not take time.

[![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/google_play.jpg) ](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) [![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/apple_store.jpg)](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6)

**Free version available**

Filmora Pro (1 Year) — $32.99

Filmora Pro （1 Month） — $6.99

### 2\. LumaFusion (best for iPad)

Recommended for iPad users, LumaFusion is a multitrack mobile video editor used by professionals.

**Pros:**

* Uncluttered, intuitive, and customizable user interface
* Advanced and adjustable image stabilizer
* Simple color correction — you do not have to fret with color wheels, video scopes, auto white balance, nodes, or any settings; instead, it includes a handful of color presets and sliders to make the process more convenient.
* Edit up to six layers of audio and video
* Supports all major video formats and more!

**Cons:**

* No android app available yet
* Not friendly for beginners
* No free version

**Price:** US$ 29.99, extra subscription for Storyblocks needed

### 3\. iMovie

## Part 3: FAQ

**Is the New M1 iPad Pro Good for Video Editing?**

Like most Apple products, the iPad Pro exterior hasn’t changed much compared to its predecessors, as the real magical upgrades are inside. The new M1 chip, the magnificent XDR display, 120Hz Refresh Rate, unbelievable Performance, Magic Keyboard, Thunderbolt 3, and USB 4 is enough to recognize the latest iPad Pro as the most powerful tablet ever made that can do everything that a Laptop can! Other hallmarks like the trackpad and magnetic slide — make it the perfect substitute for anyone looking to replace their laptop with an iPad Pro for video editing.

## Part4: Conclusion

Touch screens can be difficult to handle when performing precise operations like video-editing; that is why it is critical to use only the best video-editors on iPad.
