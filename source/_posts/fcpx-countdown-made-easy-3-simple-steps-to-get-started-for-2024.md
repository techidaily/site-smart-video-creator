Developed by Lightricks Studio, Videoleap is one of the most powerful video editors, which is available for iOS and Android devices. While you can directly install Videoleap on your iPhone or Android phone by visiting its App/Play Store page, you won’t find its desktop application. That’s why a lot of people find it hard to install Videoleap on their macOS systems. Don’t worry – here, I will let you know how to install **Videoleap for MacBook** and would also list its best alternatives.

## Part 2: Download and Install Videoleap for MacBook

As I have listed above, **Videoleap for MacBook** is not directly available as it runs on iOS and Android devices only. Though, you can access this video editor on your Mac by using any reliable Android emulator tool. An emulator can load an Android OS environment on your Windows or Mac system, letting you run all these smartphone apps.

While there are plenty of Android emulators out there, these are some of the most popular options:

* BlueStacks
* Nox Player
* MEmu Player
* ARChon Player

Out of them, let’s consider the example of BlueStacks as it is the most popular and reliable Android emulator in the market. You can install BlueStacks on your MacBook for free, log in to your Google account, and can readily use Videoleap on it.

**Step 1: Install a Reliable Android Emulator like BlueStacks**

To begin with, you can install any reliable Android emulator on your MacBook. For instance, if you want to install BlueStacks, then you can visit its official website, and click on the “Download” button.

Now, you can just click on the installer to run it on your MacBook. You can just go through a simple click-through process and select a location where you want to install the application on your Mac.

Just make sure that you have at least 5GB of available storage of your Mac (and it should have at least 2GB RAM).

## Part 3: 2 Best Alternatives to Videoleap for MacBook
