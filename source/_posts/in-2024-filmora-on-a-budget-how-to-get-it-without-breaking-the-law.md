Another method is for users who have already installed Filmora on their devices. If you are using Filmora, you do not need to crack it in order to get **Filmora free**. You can earn the Filmora license by doing the mission of exporting three videos in total from the software. The method is quite simple and easy, but the mission is only available for Filmora 10.2 and above versions for a limited time. And the mission may be taken down sometime.

In order to do so, you have to follow the steps mentioned below.

Filmora currently offers around 30 split screen templates. You can add up to 6 different video clips in these presets at the same time. The default duration of the split screen is 5 seconds, but you can adjust it according to your requirements. You can add all kinds of borders, do a color correction, tuning and apply motion effects on your split-screen.

### 3. Filmora Beat Detection

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** offers a Beat Detection option for users, which marks audio beats from the inserted sound clip in your video automatically.
