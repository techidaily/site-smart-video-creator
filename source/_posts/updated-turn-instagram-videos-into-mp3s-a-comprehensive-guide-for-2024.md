Fortunately, there are easy ways to fix the problem when they are not properly working inside the Final Cut Pro X. Generally, the issue can be fixed by simply updating and re-installing the plugin in your system but if that does not work, consider the below checklist of the elements you should consider fixing the problems related to the generators, effects, transitions, and titles inside the Final Cut Pro X.

* **Searching on the Correct Part** \- When looking for the plugin, you should always ensure looking for it in the correct part of the Final Cut Pro X. For instance, if you are looking for the effects, make sure that you are checking them in the effects panel.
* **Proper Installation** \- The next tip that you must consider is the correct and proper installation of the plugin. You should follow the steps of the plugin installation in order to avoid incorrect installation in your Final Cut Pro X.
* **Localization of the Folders** \- Now comes the localization of the folders meaning their placement. You should ensure keeping your motion effects, templates, generators, transitions, and titles folders localized.
* **Placement of the Effects and Transitions** \- While placing your titles and generators, you should ensure that they go on the top of your timeline however the transitions can go in between the two clips on the timeline and the effects can be dropped directly into the video clip.
* **Delete the Plugin from Everywhere** \- You should always consider deleting the plugin from everywhere in your system if it continues to trouble you. Delete it from the finder and trash folders, then re-download, re-install and restart your system.
* **Seek Help from the Plugin Creator** \- If none of the aforementioned tips helps, you should definitely turn to the service provider or the plugin creator who can offer you their expert assistance.
