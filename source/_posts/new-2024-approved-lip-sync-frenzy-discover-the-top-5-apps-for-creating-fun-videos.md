You don’t have to be a music prodigy to create an amazing music video, you don’t even have to know how to sing, because there are hundreds of iOS and Android-based apps that let you create a lip sync video. The only important thing is to move your lips and appear to be saying the same words at the exact same moment as the real singer of the song you’re covering. **Lip syncing** allows you to focus on your dancing or any other action you’re planning on doing in a video and reduces the need to perform a song perfectly.

**Lip sync videos** are a great source of fun, and producing them doesn’t require you to have a professional video or sound equipment. In this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the **best lip sync apps on iPhone and Android phones**, and we are going to show you **how to use them to create amazing lip sync videos**.

## Making Lip Sync Videos with 5 Best Lip Sync Apps

Lip syncing seems easier than it actually is because synchronizing the movement of your lips with the lyrics of a song can prove to be a challenging task. If the first take doesn’t turn out the way you wanted, keep trying because the practice is one of the most important aspects of creating a great lip sync video.

#### 1. TikTok

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ro/app/tiktok/id835599320?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.ugc.trill&hl=en%5FUS)

In a little over two years, TikTok has become one of the largest platforms for music videos in the world after the acquisition of Musical.ly. Currently, the app **has over 150 million daily users** and the TikTok community keeps growing at an astounding rate. You can **browse through the latest videos** on the platform or **upload your own videos**.

The **+** icon located near the bottom of the screen grants you access to the **video recording** options. To access the TikTok’s library of songs you just have to tap on the **Pick a Sound** option and select the song you want to use in your video. As you tap on a song, a **Shoot with this sound** option will appear on the screen, tap on it to begin recording a video. The **scissors icon** can be used to **set the start and end points of a song**, while the menu near the bottom of the screen lets you choose **how fast the playback** of the song is going to be. Hit the **Record** button to start making your new lip sync video and once the recording session is over hit the **Post** icon to share the video on the TikTok platform.

#### 2. Triller

**Price:** Free

Tapping the Capture button will start the video recording session and while you’re recording you can zoom in or zoom out in order to change the composition of the shot. The app’s auto editing algorithm will render the video after you stop recording, but you can still add emojis, stickers or filters to each lip sync video you create with this app, by selecting the Re Edit option. The videos you produce with this app can be shared on all of the most popular social media or on the Triller platform

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Sometimes we need to show two videos together on the same screen to convey certain usage information. If you are searching for a tool to make this task possible then Final Cut Pro is the best choice for you.

This tool can help you to use the picture-in-picture effect with ease. However, the process for adding this effect cannot be completed within one r two steps.

The article below contains complete details about how to add PIP effects using Final Cut Pro. You will be glad to know that FCP also works with few integrated plugins that assist in the free picture in picture effect generation.

## How to Create PIP Effect with FCP

If you are ready with two videos and now want to bring them to the same screen then prefer to follow these simple steps:

#### Step 1: Add Background video

The very first step that you need to follow for PIP effect generation using FCP is to bring your main or background video to the timeline as a primary storyline. Once you have created the primary storyline then all videos for the PIP effect will be added to it.

![add pip video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-pip-videos-in-fcp.jpg)

#### Step 2: Add PIP videos

It is time to choose the higher video clip so that the PIP effect can be applied. This task can be done either by using on-screen type controls available on the viewer or you can move ahead with transform controls available on the inspector.

Note that lower clips use to stay in the background in final results whereas upper clips will appear in the foreground. By default, both clips use to have 100% full screen with 100% opaque settings.

![transform button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/transform-button-in-fcp.jpg)

#### Step 3: Apply PIP effect

As now you have added both videos on-screen now you have to select the higher video and then click over the rectangular transform button that is available on the lower-left corner of viewer screen. As soon as you make this selection, the icon will turn into blue color, and naturally 8 dots will appear around the selected image or video. Use any one of these dots for scaling your selection in asymmetrical order.

![adjust pip effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-pip-effect-in-fcp.jpg)

#### Step 4: Adjust PIP Effect

* If you want to scale this image in a symmetrical fashion then simply drag the dot to the corner from the central position.
* Now hold the option key and drag one dot to the corner. It will help you to shrink as well as to enlarge the image even without affecting its actual aspect ratio.
* Users can keep on scaling this foreground image till the time they achieve essential size.
* Now click inside your selected image and start dragging it to reach a certain specific position. You can place it anywhere on a big screen.

#### Step 5: Follow precise Adjustment

Simply select the top clip and then hit Command + 4 to open the inspector. Now click on that blue show button over your FCP screen and it will provide you complete information about the transform category of available built-in effects. If you use inspector for this task then it can help you to get very precise results for scaling needs. It assists users to manage images with accurate position and size.

![precise adjustment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/precise-adjustment-in-fcp.jpg)

#### Step 6: Apply Cross- Dissolve

* Now choose the leading edge of effect and use Command + T. It will immediately apply the default cross-dissolve option for starting clip.
* You will be glad to know that the PIP effect does not restrict users to work just upon a single image rather it can be used to process as many pictures as your project needs and that can fit inside the frame.

Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don't support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren't designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.

These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let's see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.

## Part 1: How to Run Windows and Mac OS Video Editing Apps on Chromebook

As we already mentioned there are two different ways to run Mac and Windows OS video editing apps from your Chromebook, although one method is much less complicated than the other. Let's have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.

#### Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote

A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.

#### 1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote

The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app's main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.

![chromebook-remote-desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-remote-desktop.jpg)

Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you've completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.

#### 2.Choose PIN

In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn't go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.

![chromebook-pin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-pin.jpg)

#### 3.Make Connection

In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you'd like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.

![chromebook-connection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-connection.jpg)

#### 4.Optimize Options

Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you'd like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who'd like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn't offer a direct transfer of files as an option.

#### Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine

The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can't run on ARM powered Chromebooks.

* The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.
* The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.

![chromebook-virtual-machine](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-virtual-machine.jpg)

* After you've successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you'd like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.

Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.

Bonus: We highly recommend you to use our Filmora X following the instructions above, we optimized the app for it.
