Similarly, an image seen on a smartphone will have a different look when watched on a big TV screen.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

A video’s size can sometimes be a huge problem, as most [online video editing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), file conversion platforms, and social media networks have video size limits. Even though the WebM file format is created with the aim of [reducing a video’s size](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), while maintaining the image quality, WebM videos can still be too large for the platform to which you want to upload them.

Luckily, you don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars on [professional video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) just so you can resize a WebM video since there are lots of online WebM video compressors you can use for free. That’s why in this article we are going to introduce you to some of the best online WebM video compressors.

## How to Compress WebM Videos Online for Free

Before choosing an online WebM [video compressor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you should first examine the list of features the compressor you are interested in offers. In addition, you should also pay attention to the platform’s **file size limits**, since it can easily happen that the video you want to compress exceeds its limits. Let’s take a look at some of the best online WebM video compressors.

### 2\. PS2PDF

**Price:** Free

![compress WebM with PS2PDF](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compress-webm-with-ps2pdf.jpg)

This versatile file conversion platform also offers the video compression features which enables you to shrink your WebM videos with ease. PS2PDF allows you to upload files from Dropbox, Google Drive or your computer and it lets you compress multiple WebM videos at the same time. After the upload process is completed, you can decide if you want to use VP8 or VP9 video codec and choose if the file’s size is going to be reduced by a percentage, preset quality or by using variable bitrates. In addition, you can choose the method that is going to be used to resize your WebM videos or select one of the available output dimension options. Click on the Compress Now button when ready and then proceed to download the resized file to your computer.

### 3\. Clideo

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $6.00 per month

![compress WebM with Clideo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compress-webm-with-clideo.jpg)

Clideo is an online video editing platform that offers a broad range of tools you can use to cut, rotate, merge or compress video files that are saved in commonly used file formats. All you need to do in order to compress a WebM video with Clideo is to upload the file to the platform. The compression process is automatic, so you don’t have to adjust the compression settings. After the WebM video is resized you can save it to your Dropbox or Google Drive accounts or download it to your computer. All videos you compress with the free version of Clideo are going to be watermarked and you must purchase one of the available subscription models if you want to remove the watermark.

### 4\. Compress.com

**Price:** Free

![Compress WebM video in Compress.com](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compress-webm-in-compress.jpg)

As its name suggests this is a file compression platform that enables its users to resize websites, documents, images, and audio or video files. You can compress up to five WebM videos that can have a maximum size of 200MB at the same time. The platform lets you choose if you want to change overall video quality or specified video parameters, so you should select the second option if you would like to customize the size, bitrate, frame rate and aspect ratio options. Additionally, you can click on the remove all audio tracks checkbox if you don’t want your compressed WebM video to contain sound. The resized WebM video is going to be displayed in the Output Files section of the screen and you just have to click on it if you would like to download it.

### 5\. Compressify

**Price:** Free

![Compress WebM with Compressify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compressify-compress-webm-video.jpg)

Reducing a video’s size with Compressify requires a minimum amount of effort because you just have to upload a WebM video and the platform will do the rest for you. However, the maximum size of a video file you can compress with this online tool is limited to just 8MB which makes it a good choice only if you are compressing short WebM videos. Compressify reduces the size of your video files by 60% while maintaining excellent image quality. Even though the size of WebM videos you upload to this platform cannot exceed 8MB, the file compression process is incredibly slow.

### 6\. ClipChamp
