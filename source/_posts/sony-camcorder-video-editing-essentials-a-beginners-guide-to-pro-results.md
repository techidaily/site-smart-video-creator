Sony is one of the brands that are popular with video makers, and in this tutorial we walk you through the steps on editing videos shot by Sony camcorder.

### Basic Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The increase in popularity of Chromebooks, over the past several years is more than justified because these devices have proven that they are much more than just a web-browsing tool. Using a Chromebook for educational purposes or to widen your network of business associates is becoming more common, while new upgrades of the OS bring improvements at an astounding rate.

However, editing visual content isn't that easy for Chromebook users, because Windows or Mac applications can't be used that easily on these devices. That is the reason why online video editors play a large role for all Chromebook owners who want to create videos that meet at least some of the professional standards. Luckily, currently, there is a large number of online video editors available that can offer a solid video editing experience to users who would like to piece their video clips together into visually attractive content.

Let's have a look at some of the best online video editors that will help you create visually engaging videos.

#### 2.[Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

![Magisto Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magisto-upload.jpg)

**Price:** Starts at $2,49 per month and goes up to $39,99 per month

With Magisto there is no need to spend countless hours editing your business videos, however different pricing plans offer different amounts of options. The pricing plan for Marketers that comes at $39,99 per month allows its users to create video optimized for branding and advertising.

Depending on the price package users can have access to 20 or 30-minute timelines, which limits the possibilities of users who would like to produce longer videos. Even though a number of visual effects offered by Loopster isn't as big as some users could expect, the online video editor enables them to slow down or speed up videos up to five times.

The owners of Movie Producer Membership, Education, and Business packages have access to over 600 sound effects, while all packages allow users to add text and graphics to the images they are processing. The maximum video resolution this online video editor can produce is 1080p, regardless of the pricing plan, but if you opt to use the free version of Loopster, the maximum video resolution is 480p.
