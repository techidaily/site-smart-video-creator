In addition, it's a great idea to play the video in repeat mode when you find a certain piece of a video or an entire clip very intriguing and want to watch it again and again for yourself, your friends, or your intended audience on your social media account.

The loopers come in here because they help make the movie loop several times. In this article, we will share a list of free **Video Looper** online solutions that, according to their regulations, enable you to repeat a piece of video.

#### In this article

01 [Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac](#part1)

02 [Create Boomerang Loop with](#part2)[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac

Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it's a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you'll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.

### 1\. [Window Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287)

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.

Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

It can also play your video on loop. Here's how:

## Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac

Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it's a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you'll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.

### 1\. [Window Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287)

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

It can also play your video on loop. Here's how:
