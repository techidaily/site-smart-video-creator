04 [Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?

Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9\. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.

A video that's portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.

Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it's far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.

Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal **phone aspect ratio vertical**.

## Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens

The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn't be mistaken for 'display/screen size' calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.

The **phone aspect ratio vertical** is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It's also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.

It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16/9.

**Types of Aspect ratio**

**●**   **16:9 Aspect Ratio**

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.

It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.

![16:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone2.jpg)

Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.

On the other hand, you'll experience the "**Letterboxing effect**" on devices that aren't available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars/bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.

![letterbox image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone3.jpg)

**●**   **18:9 Aspect ratio**

This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.

The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be "black bands" at the top, bottom or to your display's right or left.

![18:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg)

The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.

**●**   **19:9 Aspect ratio**

19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.

The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you'll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.

**Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions**

Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google/Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16\. (16:9 standing up!) and it's the ideal size for **iPhone vertical video dimensions**.

The highest quality vertical video's output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).

The highest quality vertical video's output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).

**Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video**

Let's now understand the **mobile vertical video size**! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.

![video aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone5.jpg)

Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!

It's because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.

## Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?

Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9\. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.

A video that's portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.

Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it's far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.

Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal **phone aspect ratio vertical**.

## Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens

The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn't be mistaken for 'display/screen size' calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.

The **phone aspect ratio vertical** is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It's also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.

It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16/9.

**Types of Aspect ratio**

**●**   **16:9 Aspect Ratio**

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.

It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.

![16:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone2.jpg)

Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.

On the other hand, you'll experience the "**Letterboxing effect**" on devices that aren't available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars/bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.

![letterbox image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone3.jpg)

**●**   **18:9 Aspect ratio**

This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.

The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be "black bands" at the top, bottom or to your display's right or left.

![18:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg)

The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.

**●**   **19:9 Aspect ratio**

19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.

The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you'll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.

**Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions**

Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google/Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16\. (16:9 standing up!) and it's the ideal size for **iPhone vertical video dimensions**.

The highest quality vertical video's output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).

The highest quality vertical video's output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).

**Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video**

Let's now understand the **mobile vertical video size**! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.

![video aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone5.jpg)

Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!

It's because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.
