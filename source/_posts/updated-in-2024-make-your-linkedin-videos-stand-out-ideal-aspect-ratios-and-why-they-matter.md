## Part 3 5 types of LinkedIn Ads

LinkedIn provides you with several platforms and types of ad placements. Here mentioned are some of them:

**Sponsored messages in LinkedIn:** This type of LinkedIn ad was previously termed as sponsored InMail. Through this, you can directly advertise your product or brand in the user’s inbox. However, LinkedIn has set a maximum number of times that your customer can receive the messaging ad. This states that any member of your audience will not receive the ads more than two times in a short span of time. Also, it is estimated that consumers enjoy messaging ads but companies do not interact much with them via sponsored messaging ads.

![Sponsored messaging on LinkedIn](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/linkedin-video-aspect-ratio-2.jpg)

**Sponsored content:** These ads show up in the feed of the LinkedIn user. No matter if they are using it on mobile on desktop. These sponsored contents also have a label of promotion on them. This makes them different from the regular contents. If you are choosing sponsored content then you also get the choice between carousel ads, video ads and images ads.

![Sponsored content on LinkedIn](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/linkedin-video-aspect-ratio-3.jpg)

**Dynamic ads:** These ads are visible on the right rail as you open the LinkedIn. Also this is the best way to speak to your audience through personalization. The users get to see their own personal details as soon these ads pop up on the screen. This can even be changed through the settings so that the details get hidden if the user finds this to be very personal. Dynamic ads are also of two types. One is follower ads and other is sponsored ads.

![Dynamic ads video requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/linkedin-video-aspect-ratio-4.jpg)

**Text ads:** These ads are considered as the best way to build a strong lead amongst the audience. This is also suitable in the terms of professional demographic. These ads are shown on the top and right side of the feed of LinkedIn. Approximately 58% of the companies say that making the lead generation better is the top priority of digital marketing. This is also a good way to manage company’s budget.

![Text ad videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/linkedin-video-aspect-ratio-5.jpg)

**Awareness ads:** If you want to make your brand stay on the tips of your audience then it is a good idea to go for awareness ads. These ads build a communication amongst the audience related to your brands, products and services, etc. These awareness ads also boost the engagement, help to gain followers and increase the views.

Size, formats, and resolution… What are pixels exactly doing with it?

![pixel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio1.jpg)

So let's review some basics on pixel calculator ratio to create an easy life, your workflow more productive, and your photos of the ideal size for the intended purpose.

02 [How is Pixel Ratio Calculated?](#Part 2)

03 [Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro/Filmora?](#Part 3)

04 [Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)

05 [How Aspect Ratios Affect UI/UX Design?](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?

A digital image is not a single non-dividable thing. You’ll see that your photo is like a mosaic formed by small tiles if you zoom in far enough, which are known as pixels in photography.

The amount of these pixels and the way they are divided are the two elements that you’re required to take into account to know more about the resolution and **pixel** **calculator ratio**.

The Pixel Aspect Ratio is simply the latest way of defining the length of one side of a pixel in context to the length of the other.

Let's say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.

If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.

**NOTE**: The 'Aspect Ratio' does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its "relative" size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it. But if the **Pixel Calculator Ratio** is 1:1, then the pixels will always be square irrespective of the size of that particular photo.

![pixel aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio2.jpg)

## Part 2 How is Pixel Ratio Calculated?

You can use a **pixel ratio calculator** to calculate the pixels within a screen. So, we'd like to suggest a calculator by xwebtools.com.

Here, you can see tabs, namely the **Common Ratios** **Ratio Width**, **Ratio Height**, **Pixels Width**, and **Pixels Height**.

![xwebtools pixel ratio calculator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio3.jpg)

**How it works:**

This **pixel ratio calculator** converts pixel dimensions to aspect ratios. It is an online free tool that assists you in calculating the aspect ratio value of an object or a photo.

The conversion can be carried in both ways, aspect ratio to pixels and pixels to aspect ratio. This screen resolution calculator offers a powerful and simple tool that can convert the ratio of images to pixels resolution and pixels to ratio dimensions.

You need to provide Pixels Width and Pixels Height to calculate the aspect ratio; the aspect ratio will be automatically calculated.

You need to provide Ratio Height and Ratio Width to calculate pixel resolutions. Both the Pixels Width and Height will get automatically calculated.

## Part 3 What is Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro/Filmora?

**Pixel ratio: Adobe Premiere Pro**

As we already discussed, an aspect ratio defines width to height. The still picture and video frames have a frame aspect ratio. The pixels that create the frame have a pixel aspect ratio (sometimes called PAR).

Different video recording standards have different aspect ratios. For instance, you record video for television in either a 16:9 or a 4:3 frame aspect ratio.

You set the frame and pixel aspect when you create a project in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you set these ratios, you can't change them for that project. However, you can edit the aspect ratio of a sequence. You can also use assets made with different aspect ratios in the project.

Premiere Pro automatically compensates for the pixel aspect ratio of source files.

If an asset still feels distorted, you can manually mention its pixel aspect ratio. But that isn't very clear, especially for a beginner. This is why we recommend doing the following.

**Pixel ratio: Wondershare Filmora**

You need a converter or a video editor to change the aspect ratio permanently. Here we humbly recommend an excellent aspect ratio changer - [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor, which helps you make 4:3, 9:16, 16:9, and 1:1 aspect ratio videos pretty quickly.

Thus, using the Wondershare Filmora along with the **pixel ratio calculator** makes a difference!

## Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio

Although the image aspect ratio comes from its width and height, it also contains multiple subsets that help to define image proportions properly.

1 - **Pixel aspect ratio**

Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.

But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.

2 - **Display aspect ratio**

The display aspect ratio (DAR) is the designers' most frequent aspect ratio and gets generally synced with the general term.

As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.

Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.

They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.

They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.

3 - **Storage aspect ratio**

Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.

SAR x PAR = DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.

## Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI/UX Design?

Aspect ratios play a vital part in any project that consists of displaying and capturing photographs, videos, or other image-based files in an ideal manner. The camera's fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.

And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.

But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.

A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.

In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor's negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site's usability.

Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that's too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor's want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.

Various **pixel calculator ratios**, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.

Premiere Pro automatically compensates for the pixel aspect ratio of source files.

If an asset still feels distorted, you can manually mention its pixel aspect ratio. But that isn't very clear, especially for a beginner. This is why we recommend doing the following.

## Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio

Although the image aspect ratio comes from its width and height, it also contains multiple subsets that help to define image proportions properly.

1 - **Pixel aspect ratio**

Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.

But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.

2 - **Display aspect ratio**

The display aspect ratio (DAR) is the designers' most frequent aspect ratio and gets generally synced with the general term.

As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.

Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.

They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.

They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.

3 - **Storage aspect ratio**

Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.

SAR x PAR = DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.

## Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI/UX Design?

Aspect ratios play a vital part in any project that consists of displaying and capturing photographs, videos, or other image-based files in an ideal manner. The camera's fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.

And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.

But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.

A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.

In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor's negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site's usability.

Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that's too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor's want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.

Various **pixel calculator ratios**, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.

Size, formats, and resolution… What are pixels exactly doing with it?

![pixel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio1.jpg)

So let's review some basics on pixel calculator ratio to create an easy life, your workflow more productive, and your photos of the ideal size for the intended purpose.

#### In this article

02 [How is Pixel Ratio Calculated?](#Part 2)

03 [Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro/Filmora?](#Part 3)

04 [Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)

05 [How Aspect Ratios Affect UI/UX Design?](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?

A digital image is not a single non-dividable thing. You’ll see that your photo is like a mosaic formed by small tiles if you zoom in far enough, which are known as pixels in photography.

The amount of these pixels and the way they are divided are the two elements that you’re required to take into account to know more about the resolution and **pixel** **calculator ratio**.

The Pixel Aspect Ratio is simply the latest way of defining the length of one side of a pixel in context to the length of the other.

Let's say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.

If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.

**NOTE**: The 'Aspect Ratio' does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its "relative" size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it. But if the **Pixel Calculator Ratio** is 1:1, then the pixels will always be square irrespective of the size of that particular photo.

![pixel aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio2.jpg)

## Part 2 How is Pixel Ratio Calculated?

You can use a **pixel ratio calculator** to calculate the pixels within a screen. So, we'd like to suggest a calculator by xwebtools.com.

Here, you can see tabs, namely the **Common Ratios** **Ratio Width**, **Ratio Height**, **Pixels Width**, and **Pixels Height**.

![xwebtools pixel ratio calculator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio3.jpg)

**How it works:**

This **pixel ratio calculator** converts pixel dimensions to aspect ratios. It is an online free tool that assists you in calculating the aspect ratio value of an object or a photo.

The conversion can be carried in both ways, aspect ratio to pixels and pixels to aspect ratio. This screen resolution calculator offers a powerful and simple tool that can convert the ratio of images to pixels resolution and pixels to ratio dimensions.

You need to provide Pixels Width and Pixels Height to calculate the aspect ratio; the aspect ratio will be automatically calculated.

You need to provide Ratio Height and Ratio Width to calculate pixel resolutions. Both the Pixels Width and Height will get automatically calculated.

## Part 3 What is Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro/Filmora?

**Pixel ratio: Adobe Premiere Pro**

As we already discussed, an aspect ratio defines width to height. The still picture and video frames have a frame aspect ratio. The pixels that create the frame have a pixel aspect ratio (sometimes called PAR).

Different video recording standards have different aspect ratios. For instance, you record video for television in either a 16:9 or a 4:3 frame aspect ratio.

You set the frame and pixel aspect when you create a project in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you set these ratios, you can't change them for that project. However, you can edit the aspect ratio of a sequence. You can also use assets made with different aspect ratios in the project.

Premiere Pro automatically compensates for the pixel aspect ratio of source files.

If an asset still feels distorted, you can manually mention its pixel aspect ratio. But that isn't very clear, especially for a beginner. This is why we recommend doing the following.

There is a wide variety of prominent **video to audio converter** tools available in the digital market. The basic concept behind these tools is to extract the audio content from your favorite video and save it as an MP3 file.

The RIP of the audio is pretty different from the inbuilt program within the application. Many experienced professionals opt for an MP3 file format because of its high-frequency audio quality, smaller file size, etc.

After you convert **the video to MP3**, you will listen to the audio or the background music offline, and the MP3 file format guarantees flawless audio quality.

We want to introduce you to [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which offers many professional and basic video effects and editing tools and converts **video to** **MP3**.

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

We’ve picked out some of the best **audio converters** available right now based on several different factors

You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert Audio?](#Part 1)

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting 'CONVERT’.

![Start conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%204.png)

****Step 5: Download or Save File!**

Once the conversion has been completed, your **audio converter** will either give you an option to 'DOWNLOAD’ or 'SAVE’ the finished product to your device!

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

We’ve picked out some of the best **audio converters** available right now based on several different factors

You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert Audio?](#Part 1)

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting 'CONVERT’.

![Start conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%204.png)

****Step 5: Download or Save File!**

Once the conversion has been completed, your **audio converter** will either give you an option to 'DOWNLOAD’ or 'SAVE’ the finished product to your device!

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…
