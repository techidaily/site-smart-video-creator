#### 4\. [Video Toolbox](http://www.videotoolbox.com/)

 Video Toolbox is an online video editing tool which has a rich set of video tools. To use the video editing tools, you have to register (it’s free). The menu on the left lists all the functions. Cutting videos into smaller parts comes in two modes "Simple" and "Advanced". But like many online apps, Video Toolbox imposes a size restriction of 300MB for your video files.
