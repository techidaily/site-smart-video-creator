 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue [why 4K is better than 1080P](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before. Though there are some 4K devices just as what we have rated before such as [4K TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K smartphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and[4K camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) nowadays, 4k being relatively new, not all people have access to 4K devices and sometimes, and there are rather limited options to play 4K videos in a [4k video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). 4k being relatively new, there are not many devices that support 4k and rather limited options to play these videos in a 4k video player.

Since uploading 4K videos to online video converters may take much time, so in this article, we will share some of the best 4K video converters that allow you to convert 4K to 1080P resolution or other resolutions in MP4, MOV, MKV or other formats easily on Windows and Mac only.

While we’ve updated the list of best 4K video converters and add some more Video Converters that support 4K resolution. Both of them support Windows and Mac versions, and some of them are totally free to use while others may need to pay to convert 4K video footage.

### 4k vs 1080p

It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?

**Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?**

The answer is **Yes**, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.

![4kvs1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4kvs1080.png)

Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.

So do not wait…

Let us dive into the detail:

### What is a 4k?

As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has **3840 x 2160px** or **4096 x 2160** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.

![4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4k.png)

**Pros**

* When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.
* It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.
* It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.
* If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.  
**Cons**
* It occupies more space on your camera.
* It is harder to record.
* It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.
* There is limited content for 4k videos.  

### What is a1080p?  

As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has **1920 x 1080px** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.  
![1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/1080.png)  
**Pros**

* You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.
* It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.
* It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).
* It has a much better focus than 4k.
* Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.
* 1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. **Cons**
* Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.
* It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.
* You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.  
![scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/scale.png)  
In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.

### 4k vs 1080p

It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?

**Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?**

The answer is **Yes**, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.

![4kvs1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4kvs1080.png)

Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.

So do not wait…

Let us dive into the detail:

### What is a 4k?

As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has **3840 x 2160px** or **4096 x 2160** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.

* It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.
* It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.
* If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.  
**Cons**
* It occupies more space on your camera.
* It is harder to record.

* It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.
* It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).
* It has a much better focus than 4k.
* Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.
* 1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. **Cons**
* Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.
* It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.
* You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.  
![scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/scale.png)

We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue [why 4K is better than 1080P](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before. Though there are some 4K devices just as what we have rated before such as [4K TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K smartphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and[4K camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) nowadays, 4k being relatively new, not all people have access to 4K devices and sometimes, and there are rather limited options to play 4K videos in a [4k video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). 4k being relatively new, there are not many devices that support 4k and rather limited options to play these videos in a 4k video player.

While we’ve updated the list of best 4K video converters and add some more Video Converters that support 4K resolution. Both of them support Windows and Mac versions, and some of them are totally free to use while others may need to pay to convert 4K video footage.

### 4k vs 1080p

It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?

**Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?**

The answer is **Yes**, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.

![4kvs1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4kvs1080.png)

Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.

So do not wait…

Let us dive into the detail:

### What is a 4k?

As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has **3840 x 2160px** or **4096 x 2160** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.

![4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4k.png)

**Pros**

* When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.
* It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.
* It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.
* If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.  
**Cons**
* It occupies more space on your camera.
* It is harder to record.
* It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.
* There is limited content for 4k videos.  

### What is a1080p?  

As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has **1920 x 1080px** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.  
![1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/1080.png)  
**Pros**

* You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.
* It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.
* It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).
* It has a much better focus than 4k.
* Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.
* 1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. **Cons**
* Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.
* It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.
* You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.  
![scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/scale.png)  
In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.
