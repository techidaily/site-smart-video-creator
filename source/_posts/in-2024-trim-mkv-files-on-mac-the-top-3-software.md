## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

 When done, simply click on the Convert Now button and then after the conversion process is completed, proceed to download your video to your computer. The only downside is that you cannot convert WebM video files that are larger than 200MB with Aconvert.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

[TikTok](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok-make-your-day/id835599320) is a Chinese video-making and sharing social networking application used to create short dances, lip syncs, comedy and talent recordings, and much more. The introduction of the reaction feature in Tiktok enables the users to make and share their opinions about a particular event without leaving the application, therefore attracting more users even from other social media platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

![Make Reaction Video with TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-reaction-video-maker-app.jpg)

To record a reaction, you can begin playing the video, tap the **Share** icon to open the menu and tap the **React** option.

Although not particularly a reaction video maker app, iMovie can be used to create plenty of them by recording your footage on your smartphone, downloading the source videos from TikTok, transferring both the clips to your Mac computer with iMovie installed (or installing iMovie on your iOS device if you are OK comfortable with the version), doing some basic editing tasks, downloading and importing the pre-keyed effects, adding them to your reaction project, and then exporting the final reaction in your preferred format.
