Let's see which websites you can use to download the intro and title templates for Premiere Pro.

### 16. [Motion Array](https://motionarray.com/browse)

In addition to an impressive library of intro templates, Motion Array offers presets, sound effects, royalty-free music, and stock footage.

The website provides you with powerful search tools, so you can select the resolution of the template, up to 8K, or choose which types of templates are going to be displayed.

Using the free subscription plan can limit your options since you'll only be able to download free templates, and your upload storage will be limited to just 1GB.

The Pro subscription plan that can be purchased for $54 per month will grant you access to an almost endless selection of title templates as well as a huge selection of plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Motion-Array.jpg)

### 17. [Cinecom â€“ Simple Intro for Premiere Pro](https://www.cinecom.net/designer-packs/simple-titles-for-premiere-pro/)

Once you've installed all the fonts from the library, you can use them to replace the software's default library. You just have to click on the Replace Style Library option that can be accessed from Premiere Pro's Title Style tab.

If you don't feel comfortable creating your titles or if you simply don't have the time to create your own titles, the Free Cinematic Style Library is not the best choice for you.

Let's see which websites you can use to download the intro and title templates for Premiere Pro.

### 16. [Motion Array](https://motionarray.com/browse)

The website provides you with powerful search tools, so you can select the resolution of the template, up to 8K, or choose which types of templates are going to be displayed.

Using the free subscription plan can limit your options since you'll only be able to download free templates, and your upload storage will be limited to just 1GB.

The Pro subscription plan that can be purchased for $54 per month will grant you access to an almost endless selection of title templates as well as a huge selection of plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Motion-Array.jpg)

Once you've installed all the fonts from the library, you can use them to replace the software's default library. You just have to click on the Replace Style Library option that can be accessed from Premiere Pro's Title Style tab.

If you don't feel comfortable creating your titles or if you simply don't have the time to create your own titles, the Free Cinematic Style Library is not the best choice for you.

On the other hand, Premiere Pro's users who don't often use title templates can benefit from downloading RocketStock's intro library.

In this article, we will review the AVS editor briefly

## AVS Pros

### How To Use AVS Video Editor?

As soon as you have downloaded and installed the software, follow the instructions. The first time you boot up your computer after installing the software, you will see a popup for quick start instructions. It would be a great place to start someday, even if you skip it for now. For an in-depth guide on how to use the software, we recommend watching the videos.

If you open AVS Video Editor for the first time, you'll notice that it shares many features with other editing software.
