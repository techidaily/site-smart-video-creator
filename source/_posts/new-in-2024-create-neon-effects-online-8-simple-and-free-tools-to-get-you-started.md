Since its files are smaller and have fewer tools, iMovie works faster than Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro has a wide range of cutting-edge features because it was made mostly for professional editors. On the other hand, iMovie has fewer features and editing tools for people who are just starting.

1. Is Final Cut Pro challenging to learn?

You might find the interface of Final Cut Pro a little intimidating if you've used other video editing programs like iMovie. Don't worry. Learning the basic editing skills, you'll use for 90% of your work with Final Cut Pro takes a few minutes.
