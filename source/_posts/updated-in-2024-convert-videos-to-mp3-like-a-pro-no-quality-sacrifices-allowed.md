## Part 5: FAQ about Animated Logo Makers

### 1\. Which software is best for logo animation?

Logo animation software is not short on the ground. Most regular editing programs will have features that let you add an animation to your logo. We would recommend that you look at After Effects, by Adobe, since it contains numerous features specifically dealing with animation. You may even be able to use the free version of this software without paying for the whole program.

Logo animation software in aftereffects usually needs to be applied to existing footage. Otherwise, you can find it available for download by following this link.

When you are using Filmora Pro as your logo animation software, there are steps you need to take to achieve full animation. First, prepare your file by opening a new workspace with a web resolution of about 320 x 240\. Select your background layer, then add in any graphics or art you have for your logo. Choose the effect you want to apply and drag and drop it, then adjust the settings in the box that pops up.

You can assign keyframes for specific actions or play with the settings to achieve the animation you had in mind.

### 3\. How do I make an animated logo for free?

PixTeller is such an excellent service because it has logo animation software that is free to use. It allows you to work with all types of formats. So if you have a logo as a JPEG, or whether you want to draw it out in vector graphics, you can do so.

You can [change a video’s playback speed in iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) even if you have never edited a video before. After you create a new project and import a video clip into the app, you have to tap on the Speed icon. A slider that enables you to reduce a video’s playback speed to 1/8 of its original speed or make it twice as fast will appear on the screen, so you can drag it left or right to set a new playback speed for your video.

If you are not happy with the results, you can tap on the Reset button, and iMovie will return the playback speed of your video clip to its normal value.

**Pros**

* Free and easy playback speed adjustment process
* The app is compatible with all iOS-based devices
* Supports 4K video editing
* Offers a wide range of video editing tools

**Cons**

* Lacks the versatility of professional video editing apps
* Audio editing options could be better

Still can’t decide which video editing app to use for changing video speed? I’ve made a comparison table, hoping that can help you decide.
