### Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites

#### 1\. Where can I download PC games for free?

There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store & Microsoft stores. You can play & download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com & miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.

#### 2\. What is the safest website to download free games?

Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.

#### 3\. Can we download PC games on Android?

There isn't a straightforward answer to this question. By 'download,' if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia & Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (& in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.

#### 1\. Where can I download PC games for free?

There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store & Microsoft stores. You can play & download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com & miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.

#### 2\. What is the safest website to download free games?

Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.

#### 3\. Can we download PC games on Android?

There isn't a straightforward answer to this question. By 'download,' if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia & Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (& in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.

### Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites

#### 1\. Where can I download PC games for free?

There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store & Microsoft stores. You can play & download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com & miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.

#### 2\. What is the safest website to download free games?

Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.

#### 3\. Can we download PC games on Android?

There isn't a straightforward answer to this question. By 'download,' if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia & Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (& in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.

5. Click the **Video Looper** icon from the top-right corner of the browser
6. Click **Create Repeat**
7. Enter a value (the number of times you want to loop the video) in the **Repeat Times** field
8. Optionally enter the relevant values in the **Start Time** and **End Time** fields to trim the footage
9. Click **Create**
10. Click **Start & Play** on the next box that appears to play the YouTube video for the number of times you specified

**Pros**

* Free to use
* Can create an unlimited number of presets to play the videos in loops

**Cons**

* Doesn’t allow you to download the videos

**Summary**

Depending on your budget, frequency of **video loop** requirements, and the level of details you need while preparing a full-fledged video with repetitions, you can choose any of the tools explained above. However, if you need a comparatively better solution, Wondershare UniConverter would be your best bet as it is not merely a **free video looper**, it also offers several other features to get a complete output with quite granular edits.
