With the instant cutter tool in Filmora, you can easily [split mp4 videos into parts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for free as you require. Click Import with Instant Cutter Tool and then open the file, move the playhead to the start position of the video part that you want to keep, and then click the Set In icon. Repeat the process to find the ending point, and then click the Add Segment button to split the video and save it as a new one. You can split several clips from the original footage.

A more accessible alternative to this approach is [using the Auto Scene Detection tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It splits your video into multiple strategic segments automatically based on scene changes. You then end up with multiple split parts of the original video which you can selectively delete and then add to the timeline.
