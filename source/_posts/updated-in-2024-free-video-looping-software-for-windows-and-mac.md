## Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac

Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it's a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you'll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.

### 1\. [Window Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287)

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.

Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

It can also play your video on loop. Here's how:

## Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac

Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it's a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you'll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.

### 1\. [Window Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287)

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.

You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

It can also play your video on loop. Here's how:

**How to Loop Video with QuickTime Player?**

If you're using a Mac and wish to generate a video loop in QuickTime Player, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Launch the **QuickTime** player to watch any video.

**Step 2**: In the taskbar at the top right of the screen, select **View**.

**Step 3:** From the drop-down option, select **Loop**. And that's it. You have put a video on loop.

![loop video quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loop-video-quicktime-player.jpg)

These two video programs simplify setting up videos to run on repeat; they don't allow you to loop individual video parts. To do so, you'll need more powerful software, such as the well-known VLC Media Player.

### 3\. [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

The VLC media player is a program that allows you to play video and music files on your computer. The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device's powerful CPUs.

This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.

 **How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?**

Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC's timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:

**Step 1:** Open the video with VLC media player. Go to **View**. Select the **Advanced Controls** option.

![vlc media player advanced controls option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-advanced-controls-option.jpg)

**Step 2**: Go to the bottom of the VLC media player, and you will find 4 controls above the play button. Click the third button **Loop from Piont A to Point B continuously** to mark the starting point of the loop; and then click the third button again to mark the end of the loop.

![vlc media player loop part of video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-loop-part-of-video.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click the Play button and you will find the video is playing loop. Until you press the Loop from point A to point B option for the third time to discontinue the looped playback, the segment of the clip you've put up will keep on playing on loop.

### 4\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

iMovie is a fantastic tool for making beautiful short films, music videos, picture slideshows, and other creative projects. You may also loop videos straight in the iMovie software; however, you'll need to utilize QuickTime to loop movies continually if you want to export them. Here are the quick and easy ways to loop a movie into iMovie.

**How to Loop Video in iMovie?**

**Step 1: Open** iMovie and then the video clip you want to loop in.

**Step 2**: Select the **Loop Playback** option from the **View** menu. Once the video begins to play, it will loop indefinitely until you stop it.

### 5\. [Windows Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4)

Microsoft Photos, a free photo viewer and editor bundled with Windows 10, provides capable image editing and photo improvements and capabilities for organizing and editing movies, all in a touch-friendly interface.

You may doodle on photographs, [apply background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [3D effects to videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and use automated object tagging to make searching easier. Microsoft Photos is a wonderful tool for dealing with digital photographs, and for certain users, it may even replace third-party photo applications.

**How to Loop Video in Windows 10 Photos app?**

Windows 10 comes with the Photos app preinstalled. It can also assist you in making your movie loop. Here's how to do it.

**Step 1:** Import your video to the Photos app, and use the trim tool to get the part you want to loop.

![trim video windows 10 photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-video-windows-10-photos.jpg)

**Step 2:** Copy and paste the trimmed video to the storyboard as many times as you like. And then click the Finish Video button to export the video.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Sharing unedited photos and videos on your social media accounts can negatively reflect on the number of views and like your posts are getting. You don’t necessarily have to know a lot about photo or video editing process in order to add a vignette to a picture or adjust its color, brightness or highlights. As a matter of fact, all you need is a great app that lets you emphasize the center of the image and darken its edges. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best vignette apps for iPhones and Android devices that make the vignetting process fun.

## Top 10 Vignette Apps in 2024 \[Free & Paid\]

Vignettes can be used to make your selfies look more artistic or to increase the contrast between the edges and the center of a landscape photo. Even though you can use vignetting in any type of photo or video, it is still advisable to carefully choose the images to which you’d like to add this effect, since the results you’re going to get depend mostly on the quality of the original footage. Here are the ten best vignette apps in 2019.

#### 1. [Apple Photos App](https://support.apple.com/photos)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

iPhone users can edit their photos with the built-in Photos app that offers a variety of photo and video shooting modes as well as a rich collection of filters and effects. The **Vignette effect** can be accessed from the **Edit Photo menu,** by tapping on the **Adjust button** and then opening the **Add menu** and selecting the effect from the list. The **Auto option** will be enabled by default and it will automatically adjust the vignette based on the composition of your photo. Alternatively, you can use the **strength, Softness or Radius** settings to control the size of the darkened area of the image or the vignette’s falloff. Even though the Photos app offers basic Vignetting tools that let you choose which part of a photo is going to be affected by the effect or how intense the effect is going to be, it is still better to use a more powerful photo editing app to create vignettes from your iPhone.

#### 2. [Final Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/app/final-touch-beautiful-high/id963756379?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-touch-vignette.jpg)

When creating a vignette, the lack of control over the feathering or opacity features can significantly limit your ability to produce vignettes that look natural. The Final Touch app is equipped with powerful vignetting tools that let you choose between **square, ellipse or circle shapes** of vignettes, move and rotate a vignette or adjust the feather size and fall off. However, the app doesn’t let you take photos, which means that all images you want to edit have to be imported from the camera roll. The Final Touch also offers a number of preset vignettes you can easily apply to a photo and customize in any way you want. After you’ve completed the vignetting process, you can share a photo to your social media accounts directly from the app.

#### 3. [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

This photo editing app offers much more than the Vignette tool, as its users can process images in both **JPEG and RAW** file formats. Tap on the **Pencil icon** to access the app’s **Tool menu**, select the **Vignette option** and then proceed to adjust the **Outer and Inner Brightness** sliders. This will enable you to precisely define how dark you want the photo’s edges to be or how bright the central part of the picture is. To change the size of the vignette you just have to pinch in or out on the phone’s screen and **Center Size option** will appear near the bottom of the screen. Tap on the **Save button** once you’re happy with the results and then hit **Export** to create a copy of the photo that contains the changes you’ve made.

#### 4. [VSCO](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco/id588013838?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&hl=en), iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsco-vignette-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful photo editor, the VSCO app is also a community of photography enthusiasts where you can discover inspiring work or connect with like-minded people. The app also features a collection of effects that enable you to recreate the look of vintage film produced by **Kodak, Fuji or Agfa.** Despite remarkably powerful photo editing options, VSCO is far from a perfect choice if you want to add a vignette to your photo since it only offers **basic vignetting tools**. You can add a vignette to a photo the same way you’d apply any other effect, but you won’t have access to advanced feathering options. iPhone and Android users in need of an app that lets them shoot and edit photos and videos should give VSCO a chance. Keep in mind that video editing options are only available if you purchase the VSCO X Membership.

#### 5. Afterlight 2

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/afterlight-2/id1293122457?mt=8)

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/afterlight-2-vignette-app.jpg)

iPhone photographers who would like to use photo editing tools such as **Curves, Selective Hue/Saturation or Clarify** are going to love using the Afterlife 2 app. Adding a vignette to a photo requires you to just tap on the **Adjustment Tools icon** and then **browse through the adjustment tools icons until you find the Vignette option**. Just tap on the Vignette icon to create the effect and then proceed to adjust the settings. Don’t expect too much control over the vignette size or feathering options, since Afterlight 2 only offers basic vignetting tools. Optionally, you can use Afterlight 2 as an **extension for the Apple Photos App** if you want to broaden the scope of photo editing tools you have at your disposal when using this native iPhone app.

#### 6. [PhotoToaster](https://itunes.apple.com/app/phototoaster-photo-editor-filters-effects-and-borders/id433671262?ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/phototoaster-photo-editor-vignette-app.jpg)

A brief look at the list of features PhotoToaster app provides will leave you wondering if there is anything this app can’t do. There are over eighty different one-click settings in **Lightning, Vignette, Texture or Border** categories that grant you total creative control over the photo editing process. You can add a vignette to a photo you imported into the app from your iPhone’s camera roll, but you can’t use PhotoToaster to take photos. Furthermore, you can use the lightning adjustments to balance the shadows and highlights or process colors on separate channels. The PhotoToaster app is a great asset to all photographers who take photos with their iPhones, not only because it lets them create vignettes in just a few taps, but because it enables them to edit their photos professionally.

#### 7. [PicsArt Photo Editor](https://picsart.com/apps/)

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.picsart.studio&hl=en), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/picsart-photo-editor-collage/id587366035?mt=8)

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picsart-vignette-app.jpg)

Besides editing photos, you can also use the PicsArt app to create collages from your Smartphone. The app is also equipped with a rich effects library that contains the Vignette effect you can easily customize and apply to a photo. **Tap on the Effects icon**, **select the Vignette effect from the Fx section and then tap on the Gear icon to customize the effect**. Adjust the **Radius and Fade** sliders before picking the color of the vignette. **Tap on the Checkmark icon to confirm the changes** you’ve made and save the photo. PicsArt is a vibrant community of photography enthusiasts where you can share your works with other users or connect with photographers you like.

#### 8. [EffectsStudio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/effects-studio/id780467456?mt=8)

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/effects-studio-app.jpg)

The user-friendly interface and the abundance of photo editing options, make the EffectsStudio one of the best iOS-based photo editing app you can use to add vignettes to your photos. You just have to import a photo from the camera roll and enter the app’s **Edit mode** to start processing a photo. You can adjust the Vignette effect’s settings, by simply dragging sliders, and all changes you make will be immediately displayed on the screen. Make sure to complete all basic photo editing actions before you add a vignette to a photo in order to avoid losing a part of a picture. The app offers nearly eighty standard filters, more than two hundred custom filters as well as fifty effects you can use to enhance your photos.

#### 9. [EyeEm](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eyeem-photography/id445638931?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baseapp.eyeem&hl=en), iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eyeem-photography-vignette.jpg)

EyeEm is a global community of photographers, where you can sell your photos, develop your photography skills or connect with photographers whose work you admire. You can use some of the adjustable photo filters or manipulate your images in any way you want with this app. Creating a vignette with EyeEm is easy since you just have to apply the effect and tweak the settings. The best part is that you can combine the Vignette effect with other options such as **Contrast, Exposure or Sharpen** to create a visual style you want. Sharing photos on this platform can help you get useful advice from more experienced photographers who can suggest a creative way to use vignettes or any other photo effects.

#### 10. [ToolWiz Photos](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.btows.photo&hl=en%5FUS)

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** Android, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/toolwiz-photos/id1002417201?mt=8)

This simple photo editing app offers **AI filters**, and effects you can apply to a picture in just a single tap. All effects, including the Vignette effect located in the **Photography menu**, are fully customizable, so you can **adjust the radius or choose where the center of the vignette is going to be**. When done, you just have to tap on the **Checkmark icon** to confirm the changes you made and then proceed to apply an art filter like **Grainy Film or use Fish Eye, Double Exposure or Mirror effects**. The app’s file sharing capabilities could be better since you have to save all the photos you edit to your phone.

**Conclusion**

Making the edges of a photo darker can without a doubt make your photos stand out, but falling in love with vignettes and using this effect excessively is not necessarily a great idea. Using vignettes in your photos subtly so they aren’t easy to notice will probably create the best results. Which iPhone or Android vignette app do you use to edit your photos? Leave a comment and let us know.

Here are the ten best vignette apps in 2019.

#### 1. [Apple Photos App](https://support.apple.com/photos)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

iPhone users can edit their photos with the built-in Photos app that offers a variety of photo and video shooting modes as well as a rich collection of filters and effects. The **Vignette effect** can be accessed from the **Edit Photo menu,** by tapping on the **Adjust button** and then opening the **Add menu** and selecting the effect from the list. The **Auto option** will be enabled by default and it will automatically adjust the vignette based on the composition of your photo. Alternatively, you can use the **strength, Softness or Radius** settings to control the size of the darkened area of the image or the vignette’s falloff. Even though the Photos app offers basic Vignetting tools that let you choose which part of a photo is going to be affected by the effect or how intense the effect is going to be, it is still better to use a more powerful photo editing app to create vignettes from your iPhone.

#### 2. [Final Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/app/final-touch-beautiful-high/id963756379?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-touch-vignette.jpg)

When creating a vignette, the lack of control over the feathering or opacity features can significantly limit your ability to produce vignettes that look natural. The Final Touch app is equipped with powerful vignetting tools that let you choose between **square, ellipse or circle shapes** of vignettes, move and rotate a vignette or adjust the feather size and fall off. However, the app doesn’t let you take photos, which means that all images you want to edit have to be imported from the camera roll. The Final Touch also offers a number of preset vignettes you can easily apply to a photo and customize in any way you want. After you’ve completed the vignetting process, you can share a photo to your social media accounts directly from the app.

#### 3. [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

This photo editing app offers much more than the Vignette tool, as its users can process images in both **JPEG and RAW** file formats. Tap on the **Pencil icon** to access the app’s **Tool menu**, select the **Vignette option** and then proceed to adjust the **Outer and Inner Brightness** sliders. This will enable you to precisely define how dark you want the photo’s edges to be or how bright the central part of the picture is. To change the size of the vignette you just have to pinch in or out on the phone’s screen and **Center Size option** will appear near the bottom of the screen. Tap on the **Save button** once you’re happy with the results and then hit **Export** to create a copy of the photo that contains the changes you’ve made.

#### 4. [VSCO](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco/id588013838?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&hl=en), iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsco-vignette-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful photo editor, the VSCO app is also a community of photography enthusiasts where you can discover inspiring work or connect with like-minded people. The app also features a collection of effects that enable you to recreate the look of vintage film produced by **Kodak, Fuji or Agfa.** Despite remarkably powerful photo editing options, VSCO is far from a perfect choice if you want to add a vignette to your photo since it only offers **basic vignetting tools**. You can add a vignette to a photo the same way you’d apply any other effect, but you won’t have access to advanced feathering options. iPhone and Android users in need of an app that lets them shoot and edit photos and videos should give VSCO a chance. Keep in mind that video editing options are only available if you purchase the VSCO X Membership.

#### 5. Afterlight 2

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/afterlight-2/id1293122457?mt=8)

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/afterlight-2-vignette-app.jpg)

iPhone photographers who would like to use photo editing tools such as **Curves, Selective Hue/Saturation or Clarify** are going to love using the Afterlife 2 app. Adding a vignette to a photo requires you to just tap on the **Adjustment Tools icon** and then **browse through the adjustment tools icons until you find the Vignette option**. Just tap on the Vignette icon to create the effect and then proceed to adjust the settings. Don’t expect too much control over the vignette size or feathering options, since Afterlight 2 only offers basic vignetting tools. Optionally, you can use Afterlight 2 as an **extension for the Apple Photos App** if you want to broaden the scope of photo editing tools you have at your disposal when using this native iPhone app.

#### 6. [PhotoToaster](https://itunes.apple.com/app/phototoaster-photo-editor-filters-effects-and-borders/id433671262?ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/phototoaster-photo-editor-vignette-app.jpg)

A brief look at the list of features PhotoToaster app provides will leave you wondering if there is anything this app can’t do. There are over eighty different one-click settings in **Lightning, Vignette, Texture or Border** categories that grant you total creative control over the photo editing process. You can add a vignette to a photo you imported into the app from your iPhone’s camera roll, but you can’t use PhotoToaster to take photos. Furthermore, you can use the lightning adjustments to balance the shadows and highlights or process colors on separate channels. The PhotoToaster app is a great asset to all photographers who take photos with their iPhones, not only because it lets them create vignettes in just a few taps, but because it enables them to edit their photos professionally.

#### 7. [PicsArt Photo Editor](https://picsart.com/apps/)

PicsArt is a vibrant community of photography enthusiasts where you can share your works with other users or connect with photographers you like.

#### 8. [EffectsStudio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/effects-studio/id780467456?mt=8)

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/effects-studio-app.jpg)

You just have to import a photo from the camera roll and enter the app’s **Edit mode** to start processing a photo. You can adjust the Vignette effect’s settings, by simply dragging sliders, and all changes you make will be immediately displayed on the screen. Make sure to complete all basic photo editing actions before you add a vignette to a photo in order to avoid losing a part of a picture. The app offers nearly eighty standard filters, more than two hundred custom filters as well as fifty effects you can use to enhance your photos.

#### 9. [EyeEm](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eyeem-photography/id445638931?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baseapp.eyeem&hl=en), iOS

The best part is that you can combine the Vignette effect with other options such as **Contrast, Exposure or Sharpen** to create a visual style you want. Sharing photos on this platform can help you get useful advice from more experienced photographers who can suggest a creative way to use vignettes or any other photo effects.

#### 10. [ToolWiz Photos](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.btows.photo&hl=en%5FUS)

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** Android, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/toolwiz-photos/id1002417201?mt=8)

This simple photo editing app offers **AI filters**, and effects you can apply to a picture in just a single tap. All effects, including the Vignette effect located in the **Photography menu**, are fully customizable, so you can **adjust the radius or choose where the center of the vignette is going to be**. When done, you just have to tap on the **Checkmark icon** to confirm the changes you made and then proceed to apply an art filter like **Grainy Film or use Fish Eye, Double Exposure or Mirror effects**. The app’s file sharing capabilities could be better since you have to save all the photos you edit to your phone.

**Conclusion**

Making the edges of a photo darker can without a doubt make your photos stand out, but falling in love with vignettes and using this effect excessively is not necessarily a great idea. Using vignettes in your photos subtly so they aren’t easy to notice will probably create the best results. Which iPhone or Android vignette app do you use to edit your photos? Leave a comment and let us know.
