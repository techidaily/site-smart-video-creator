Stepwise instructions to modify the autosave settings in the FCPX program

Step 1: Launch the FCPX app, press Ctrl+Q to open the ‘User Preferences’ window.

Step 2: In the ‘User Preferences’ screen, you can find a wide range of options to modify. Alter the levels of Undo, autosave vault attributes according to your needs, and save the changes. You can witness these parameters in the General section in the User Preference screen.

Use the User Preference window to make necessary changes according to your requirement. BY default, the Autosave Vault is enabled, and you can work on the projects without any hesitation. Additionally, you can modify the attributes like ‘Save a copy for every’, ‘ Keep at most’, and ‘Maximum of’ to personalize your projects.

When the FCP file is open, you need not worry about the saving procedure. The app triggers the autosave mechanism for regular intervals, and the changes will be up-to-date. If you want to store the files manually, then work with its library files. A simple operation like Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v helps you to move the autosaved projects to any storage location.
