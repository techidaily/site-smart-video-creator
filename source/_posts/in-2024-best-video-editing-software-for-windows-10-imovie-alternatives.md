It has been some time since Microsoft stopped all support for Windows 7, which left PC users without the[iMovie equivalent Windows Movie Maker](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Moreover, Windows 10 doesn’t have a built-in app that is dedicated solely to video editing.

However, you shouldn’t panic if you are looking for [video editing software for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) since there are plenty of free and affordable options to choose from. In fact, finding an app you can use to polish your videos on PC computers, shouldn’t be too difficult even if you have no previous video editing experience.

That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.

## Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 \[Free & Paid\]

iMovie isn’t designed to perform demanding video editing tasks, which is the reason why we selected the video editing software products that are aimed at newcomers to the video editing world. So let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps for Windows 10 you can use as a replacement for iMovie.

### 1\. [Windows 10 Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

The Photos app is the only built-in app on Windows 10 that offers video editing features. Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.

You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.

Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.

![Editing videos in iMovie Alternative Photos App on Windows10](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows10-automatic-created-video-with-photos-app.jpg)

### 2\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you are looking for a video editing app for Windows 10 that enables you to edit the videos recorded with action cameras, Smartphones, or DSLRs, then Filmora is probably one of your best options.

Wondershare’s video editor provides support for 4K videos, and it is compatible with almost all commonly used video file formats. Starting a new project or importing the footage into Filmora is a straightforward process that requires a minimum amount of effort. Creating the opening titles, enhancing the colors in video clips, applying filters and image overlays are just a few among the countless video editing options Filmora provides.

What’s more, the video editor is equipped with a music library that contains a selection of royalty-free songs, which enables you to create a soundtrack even if you don’t have the music you can use in your videos. You can export all your projects to your accounts on Vimeo or YouTube directly from Filmora, but you should keep in mind that all videos created with the free version of this video editor are going to be watermarked.

### 3\. [Adobe Rush](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html)

Most of the applications that are included in Adobe’s Creative Suite are designed to meet the demands of professional users. However, the Adobe Rush app that is compatible with desktops and Smartphones is easy to use, and it enables you to edit even while you are on the go.

Adobe Rush enables you to capture and edit your footage from one place, and it stores all your projects on the cloud so that you can open them with Adobe Premiere Pro if you want to perform advanced video editing tasks.

The app offers instructions at every step of the video editing process, which means that you don’t need any previous video editing experience to create a new video with Adobe Rush. Moreover, sharing the videos you edit with this app on Instagram, Facebook or other social media platforms won’t take much more than a few moments of your time.

### 4\. [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/)

This is an open-source cross-platform video editing app that provides support for nearly all audio, image and video file formats, which makes it a perfect choice for PC users who often work with 4K footage.

You can use Shotcut to detach audio from video, set keyframes, or cut and trim each clip you add to the editor’s timeline. This video editing software features a rich library of transitions, which enables you to avoid hard cuts in your videos.

Moreover, Shotcut has all the tools you’re going to need in order to fine-tune the colors in each clip you want to include in the final cut of your video. The software’s audio editing capabilities are equally impressive, you can easily fade in and fade out audio files, control their volume or apply filters to them. The best part is that Shotcut doesn’t have demanding system requirements, so you can use it on computers that don’t have a lot of processing power or powerful graphics cards.

### 5\. [CyberLink PowerDirector 365](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/overview%5Fen%5FUS.html?r=1)

## Aspects You Need to Consider while Choosing the iMovie Replacement for Windows 10

Determining which video editing app for Windows 10 you should choose is going to be much easier if you already know which types of videos you want to create. Moreover, the editor you choose has to offer support for the file format or the resolution in which the video was captured. Here are some of the most important factors you need to consider before installing a new video editor on your computer.

### 1\. 4K Video Editing Support

Recording videos in 4K resolution has become more popular in recent years, as Smartphones and action cameras started offering this option. So if you are recording 4K videos often, you need video editing software that enables you to edit the videos recorded in this resolution. Moreover, you need to make sure that the video editing app you’re interested in allows you to export projects in 4K resolution.

### 2\. Cross-device Capability

Social media content creators often want to share their videos just moments after recording it. So, if you are often creating videos you share on social media, you should choose a video editor that is also compatible with iPhones and Android devices. Having the option to edit videos from both your Smartphone and your computer will make it much easier to share fresh content on social media.

### 3\. Built-in Features & Resource

The number of video editing tools, the sizes of audio and video effects libraries, or how many transitions a video editing software offers are all the factors you need to consider before you opt for one option or the other. On the other hand, getting a video editing app for Windows 10 that offers advanced video editing tools is only a good option if you are planning to learn how to use these tools.

## Conclusion

Even though Windows 10 no longer has an iMovie equivalent, it is still relatively easy to find a video editing app for Windows 10 you can use to edit your footage quickly before sharing it with your friends on social media.

You don’t need to have a ton of video editing experience in order to create videos with video editors like Filmora or Adobe Rush. Which iMovie replacement are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.

## Aspects You Need to Consider while Choosing the iMovie Replacement for Windows 10

Determining which video editing app for Windows 10 you should choose is going to be much easier if you already know which types of videos you want to create. Moreover, the editor you choose has to offer support for the file format or the resolution in which the video was captured. Here are some of the most important factors you need to consider before installing a new video editor on your computer.

### 1\. 4K Video Editing Support

Recording videos in 4K resolution has become more popular in recent years, as Smartphones and action cameras started offering this option. So if you are recording 4K videos often, you need video editing software that enables you to edit the videos recorded in this resolution. Moreover, you need to make sure that the video editing app you’re interested in allows you to export projects in 4K resolution.

### 2\. Cross-device Capability

Social media content creators often want to share their videos just moments after recording it. So, if you are often creating videos you share on social media, you should choose a video editor that is also compatible with iPhones and Android devices. Having the option to edit videos from both your Smartphone and your computer will make it much easier to share fresh content on social media.

### 3\. Built-in Features & Resource

The number of video editing tools, the sizes of audio and video effects libraries, or how many transitions a video editing software offers are all the factors you need to consider before you opt for one option or the other. On the other hand, getting a video editing app for Windows 10 that offers advanced video editing tools is only a good option if you are planning to learn how to use these tools.

## Conclusion

Even though Windows 10 no longer has an iMovie equivalent, it is still relatively easy to find a video editing app for Windows 10 you can use to edit your footage quickly before sharing it with your friends on social media.

You don’t need to have a ton of video editing experience in order to create videos with video editors like Filmora or Adobe Rush. Which iMovie replacement are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.
