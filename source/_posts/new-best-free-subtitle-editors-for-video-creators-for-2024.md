## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

GIFs are basically soundless picture collections that have been modified to resemble a video. On the other hand, videos are gathered as a kind of rich media that includes both motion and sound. What's more, the viewing experiences for these two file kinds are somewhat different.

## But why would someone want to convert a video to a GIF, to begin with? There are several explanations for this

### GIFs are inexpensive

When converting a video to a GIF, you're repurposing existing material to create something new. Why not get the most out of your video marketing strategy?

### GIFs are simple to create

You don't need to be a video expert in producing a GIF. Creating a GIF using one of the video-to-GIF converters listed below may take a few minutes.

### GIFs are simple to use

GIFs offer motion and excitement to digital information without needing the viewer to devote a significant amount of time and attention - a significant advantage given the typical human attention span of roughly 8 seconds.

### GIFs are effective

## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

## 1\. OpenShot

[OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/download/) is a free and **open-source video editor** with no premium features. In contrast, the website provides a donation option. You may use the complete range of functions without paying anything. This works with all versions of Windows, including Windows 7, Mac OS 10.15, and most Linux variants.

For a free site, it also has a fairly large variety of graphic effects, ranging from title themes and video transitions to 3D animations. OpenShot also differs from many other video editors in that it is updated regularly.

**Pros**

* Easy-to-use interface
* Unlimited layers
* Super engaging

**Cons**

* It sometimes lags, which is inconvenient

## 2\. Shotcut

[Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/) is a cross-platform, open-source video editing software with a large library of instructional videos. It also works with FFmpeg, [4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), ProRes, and DNxHD, among other formats. However, because Shotcut was created for Linux, many users may find the UI a little strange. Regardless, it's still a fantastic editor.

Shotcut also has a lot of sound editing capabilities, so it's great for audiophiles. Customers may change bass and treble, construct bandpass filters, alter gain, apply dynamic compression, and more with its array of audio fine-tuning options. FFmpeg, the dominant multimedia foundation, provides shortcut support for the newest video and audio codecs.

The native timeline editing enables customers to instantly add video files into their project folder instead of using a media library. A project uses multi-format timelines to mix up resolutions and frames per second.

**Pros**

* Offers decoding and encoding features
* Multi-format timeline

**Cons**

Lightworks is a powerful platform, featuring transitions, timeline-based editing, cloud and local storing, and no watermarks on the final video, yet being completely free to use. As a result, several additional features are only available with a Lightworks subscription account.

The premium edition of Lightworks charges $23.99 monthly, $239.99 annually, or $389.99 for a lifetime membership for a single user. In less than two years, the annual and monthly choices would cost more than a lifetime membership, so if you want to use Lightworks for a lot longer, you should select for lifetime access.

**Pros**

* A nice video editor with a lot of options
* Ideal tool for YouTube video makers who wish to edit their videos regularly
* Offers smooth service

**Cons**

* Only one option to save the project to MP4

Lightworks is compatible with most major operating systems and devices, such as Mac, Windows, and Linux. Nevertheless, because there is no Lightworks application for iOS or Android, the system is only available on the PC at this time.

Lightworks is a powerful platform, featuring transitions, timeline-based editing, cloud and local storing, and no watermarks on the final video, yet being completely free to use. As a result, several additional features are only available with a Lightworks subscription account.

The premium edition of Lightworks charges $23.99 monthly, $239.99 annually, or $389.99 for a lifetime membership for a single user. In less than two years, the annual and monthly choices would cost more than a lifetime membership, so if you want to use Lightworks for a lot longer, you should select for lifetime access.

**Pros**

* A nice video editor with a lot of options
* Ideal tool for YouTube video makers who wish to edit their videos regularly
* Offers smooth service

**Cons**

* Only one option to save the project to MP4
