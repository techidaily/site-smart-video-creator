With this app, you don’t need any video editing experience to create slow or fast motion videos. Import the footage you recorded with your Android phone and choose one of the preset video playback options. The app lets you increase or decrease a video clip’s speed up to four times, so you have to select the portion of a video you’d like to speed up or slow down and export it to your phone’s gallery.

Optionally, you can [add music to each video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you edit with this app, but you won’t be able to perform color corrections or apply visual effects to the footage you process with this app.

iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch owners can use this app to control the playback speed of all videos they record with their devices. The app’s timeline is designed to help you set points at specific segments of the video, enabling you to speed up or slow down only a portion of the video clip without cutting it.

Changing a video clip’s playback speed with this app is a simple three-step process. After you import a video clip into the app, you will be taken to the Adjust Speed screen, where you can choose if you want to alter the playback speed of an entire video clip or speed up or slow down a particular segment of a video.

Afterward, you have to drag the Video Speed slider to the left or to the right and the app will automatically adjust the speed of your video. When done, you can import an audio file from your phone and proceed to export the file to the camera roll or upload it to YouTube or Instagram.

A slider that enables you to reduce a video’s playback speed to 1/8 of its original speed or make it twice as fast will appear on the screen, so you can drag it left or right to set a new playback speed for your video.
