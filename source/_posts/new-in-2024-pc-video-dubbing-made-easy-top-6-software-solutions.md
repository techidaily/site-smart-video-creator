Since Audacity stores samples as 64-bit values (even on 32-bit devices), there is no 32-bit rule that says recordings can't be longer than 231 samples (which is for example, just over 13.5 hours at a 44,100 Hz sample rate).

1. How do I change things in Apowersoft?

Use magic and fantasy to make your edits. To cut or crop a video file, click the scissors or cropping icon, depending on what you want to do. To join videos, drag files into the timeline in the order you want. Add filters and video overlay to your movie to make it look better.
