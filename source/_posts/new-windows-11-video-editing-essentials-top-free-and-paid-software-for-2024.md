02 [Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens](#Part 2)

03 [Tips to Shoot a Vertical Video](#Part 3)

04 [Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?

Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9\. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.

A video that's portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.

Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it's far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.

Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal **phone aspect ratio vertical**.

## Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens

The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn't be mistaken for 'display/screen size' calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.

The **phone aspect ratio vertical** is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It's also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.

It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16/9.

**Types of Aspect ratio**

**●**   **16:9 Aspect Ratio**

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.

It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.

![16:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone2.jpg)

Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.

On the other hand, you'll experience the "**Letterboxing effect**" on devices that aren't available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars/bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.

![letterbox image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone3.jpg)

**●**   **18:9 Aspect ratio**

This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.

The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be "black bands" at the top, bottom or to your display's right or left.

![18:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg)

The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.

**●**   **19:9 Aspect ratio**

19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.

The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you'll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.

**Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions**

Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google/Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16\. (16:9 standing up!) and it's the ideal size for **iPhone vertical video dimensions**.

The highest quality vertical video's output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).

The highest quality vertical video's output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).

**Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video**

Let's now understand the **mobile vertical video size**! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.

![video aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone5.jpg)

Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!

It's because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.

## Part 3 Tips to Shoot a Vertical Video

Besides using the **photo ratio calculator**, we'd like to enlist some tips on getting started with your **phone aspect ratio vertical** shooting.

## Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone

Are you looking to capture the video in the correct **phone aspect ratio vertical**? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.

1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio

Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.

It's possible to create vertical videos two ways:

**●** By framing a camera in portrait mode.

**●** By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.

2 – Split the screen

You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.

Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.

You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.

3 - Fill the vertical space

You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.

![fill vertical space](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg)

When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.

The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.

![image pov](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone8.jpg)

4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)

While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.

While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.

Slow down when in doubt!

![do not shake camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone9.jpg)

5 - Remember to resize as per the platform

You don't essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm's length when you shoot videos vertically.

Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.

Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.

6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers

Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn't highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.

Line them up where they'll improve your video and scale them up as required.

## Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?

Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9\. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.

A video that's portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.

Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it's far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.

Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal **phone aspect ratio vertical**.

## Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens

The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn't be mistaken for 'display/screen size' calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.

The **phone aspect ratio vertical** is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It's also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.

It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16/9.

**Types of Aspect ratio**

**●**   **16:9 Aspect Ratio**

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.

It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.

![16:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone2.jpg)

Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.

On the other hand, you'll experience the "**Letterboxing effect**" on devices that aren't available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars/bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.

![letterbox image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone3.jpg)

**●**   **18:9 Aspect ratio**

This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.

The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be "black bands" at the top, bottom or to your display's right or left.

![18:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg)

The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.

**●**   **19:9 Aspect ratio**

19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.

The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you'll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.

Are you looking to capture the video in the correct **phone aspect ratio vertical**? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.

1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio

Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.

It's possible to create vertical videos two ways:

**●** By framing a camera in portrait mode.

**●** By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.

2 – Split the screen

You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.

Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.

You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.

3 - Fill the vertical space

You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.

![fill vertical space](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg)

When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.

The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.

![image pov](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone8.jpg)

4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)

While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.

While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.

Slow down when in doubt!

![do not shake camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone9.jpg)

5 - Remember to resize as per the platform

You don't essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm's length when you shoot videos vertically.

Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.

Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.

6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers

Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn't highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.

Line them up where they'll improve your video and scale them up as required.

# Final Cut Pro X: How to Crop an Image

Cropping an image means to remove a portion of the image, either to hide something you don't want the audience to see or emphasize different elements within the image. Just as Photoshop allows us to crop still images, Final Cut Pro X allows us to crop moving video clips, as you'll learn in this article.

---

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Crop an Image in Final Cut Pro X

However, before I show how this is done, I need to explain one really important fact about video: all video uses what's called "fixed resolution." Fixed resolution means that high-definition video is always displayed at one of two sizes:

**You May Also Like:** [How to Crop GIF Images >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* 1920 x 1080 pixels
* 1920 x 1080 pixels

Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don't like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.

I'll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called "trimming") and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called "cropping"). You get to pick which one works the best for you.

#### TRIMMING

Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop001.jpg)

For instance, here an image - courtesy of Pond5 (<www.pond5.com>). Let's say that we want to emphasize the barn and not the sky.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop002.jpg)

The easiest way to do this is to click the icon in the lower left corner of the Viewer and choose "Crop."

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop003.jpg)

This displays the cropping tools in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop004.jpg)

Click the Trim button to turn on Trim mode. (This article discusses Trim and Crop. I'll cover the Ken Burns effect in a future article.)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop005.jpg)

Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.

NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop006.jpg)

Drag other corners or edges to further trim the image.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop007.jpg)

When you have trimmed the image the way you want, click the "Done" button in the top right corner to exit trimming mode.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop008.jpg)

If no other clip is below the trimmed clip, the background will be black.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop009.jpg)

But, it actually isn't black, it's transparent. If you put another clip below it, you'll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.

Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.

#### CROPPING

Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.

There are several ways we can choose to crop an image:

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop010.jpg)

* Click the Crop icon, as we illustrated above

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop011.jpg)

* Right-mouse click (or Control-click) inside the Viewer and choose
* Type Shift+C

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop012.jpg)

\* In the Inspector > Video tab > Crop (this option provides the most precision, but is the least intuitive to use)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop013.jpg)

If you selected any option except the Inspector, click the Crop button in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop014.jpg)

Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.

Final Cut displays numbers at the top of the Viewer indicating how much the image has been cropped.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop015.jpg)

Reposition the frame by grabbing inside the rectangle and dragging.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop016.jpg)

When you are happy with the results, click the Done button in the top right corner.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop017.jpg)

Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don't see it.

And, if you look closely, you'll see that the cropped image is softer (blurrier) than the original and edges are more likely to be stair-stepped.

#### RESET

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop018.jpg)

To reset a cropped image back to its default settings, open the Inspector and click the small curved arrow to the right of the word "Crop."

#### SUMMARY

Trimming is used to hide portions of an image and superimpose it over another image.

Cropping is used to reframe an image, say from a medium shot to a close-up, but runs the risk of overly softening an image. The general rule is that cropping a little is OK, but don't crop too much.

I use both these techniques frequently in my own editing.

## How to Crop an Image in Final Cut Pro X

However, before I show how this is done, I need to explain one really important fact about video: all video uses what's called "fixed resolution." Fixed resolution means that high-definition video is always displayed at one of two sizes:

**You May Also Like:** [How to Crop GIF Images >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* 1920 x 1080 pixels
* 1920 x 1080 pixels

Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don't like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.

I'll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called "trimming") and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called "cropping"). You get to pick which one works the best for you.

#### TRIMMING

Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop001.jpg)

For instance, here an image - courtesy of Pond5 (<www.pond5.com>). Let's say that we want to emphasize the barn and not the sky.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop002.jpg)

The easiest way to do this is to click the icon in the lower left corner of the Viewer and choose "Crop."

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop003.jpg)

This displays the cropping tools in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop004.jpg)

Click the Trim button to turn on Trim mode. (This article discusses Trim and Crop. I'll cover the Ken Burns effect in a future article.)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop005.jpg)

Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.

NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop006.jpg)

Drag other corners or edges to further trim the image.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop007.jpg)

When you have trimmed the image the way you want, click the "Done" button in the top right corner to exit trimming mode.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop008.jpg)

If no other clip is below the trimmed clip, the background will be black.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop009.jpg)

But, it actually isn't black, it's transparent. If you put another clip below it, you'll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.

Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.

#### CROPPING

Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.

There are several ways we can choose to crop an image:

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop010.jpg)

* Click the Crop icon, as we illustrated above

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop011.jpg)

* Right-mouse click (or Control-click) inside the Viewer and choose
* Type Shift+C

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop012.jpg)

\* In the Inspector > Video tab > Crop (this option provides the most precision, but is the least intuitive to use)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop013.jpg)

If you selected any option except the Inspector, click the Crop button in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop014.jpg)

Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.

Final Cut displays numbers at the top of the Viewer indicating how much the image has been cropped.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop015.jpg)

Reposition the frame by grabbing inside the rectangle and dragging.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop016.jpg)

When you are happy with the results, click the Done button in the top right corner.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop017.jpg)

Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don't see it.

And, if you look closely, you'll see that the cropped image is softer (blurrier) than the original and edges are more likely to be stair-stepped.

#### RESET

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop018.jpg)

To reset a cropped image back to its default settings, open the Inspector and click the small curved arrow to the right of the word "Crop."

#### SUMMARY

Trimming is used to hide portions of an image and superimpose it over another image.

Cropping is used to reframe an image, say from a medium shot to a close-up, but runs the risk of overly softening an image. The general rule is that cropping a little is OK, but don't crop too much.

I use both these techniques frequently in my own editing.

Motion blur is the visual smearing or streaking caught on camera from the subject's movement, camera, or both. The human eye notices motion blur in real life naturally. So, a subtle blur in movies and videos makes them look more reality based.

Final Cut Pro does not have a built-in Motion Blur Effect. But there are several software and websites that allow you to add a blur effect. You need to buy the plugins and templates that will help you create this effect. In this article, we have talked about how to add the Motion Blur Effect to Final Cut Pro with the help of different templates. Without further ado, let's hop into it!

## Part1: How to Add Motion Blur in FCPX?

Usually most people would use several software and websites to add Motion Blur, but there's also a way to add the blur effect in FCPX. Follow the steps below to add motion blur in FCPX.

##### Step1Add an Adjustment Layer

Select Title from the above menu, a drop-down with several options will appear. Find the one with the adjustment layer's name and click on it. Drag the Adjustment Layer to timeline and expand it to the whole length or the specific part of the video. Adjust the settings from the menu at the left of the view.

**Note:** You must download the adjustment layer first. Generally, you will find the recently added adjustment layer in the Custom option.

![Add_an_Adjustment_Layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Add_an_Adjustment_Layer.jpg)

##### Step2Apply Transformation Effect

Select **Transformation** from the bottom left of the view, a drop-down menu will appear. Now, select **Transform** from it. You will see a white with several blue dots surrounding the view. You can use these blue dots to **Flip, Rotate,** and **Adjust the position** of the view screen.

![Apply_Transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Apply_Transition.jpg)

##### Step3Apply Keyframing and Motion Blur

While you are in the Transformation window, you will see a menu on the right of your view. From that menu, you can apply keyframing by adjusting **Position, Rotate,** and **Scale** under the **Transform** tab.

**Note:** Select the part of the video you want to apply keyframing on first.

Select the Title option from the above menu. Another menu will appear; select Motion Blur from it and apply the motion blur on video by dragging the effect to the timeline. To smooth it out, select Modify from the top and pick Random Selection from it.

![motion_blur_and_modify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/motion_blur_and_modify.jpg)

Speed up your video first by selecting the third option from the left bottom of the view. A drop-down menu will appear; choose Reset Speed. A Green bar will appear on the top of the timeline; click on it and select Fast to speed up the video. Moreover, you will have to download the Motion Blur plugin.

## Part2: How to Do Motion Blur in Easy Way?

The motion needs a sufficient amount of blur. It happens with our natural perception as well. For example, if something moves too quickly, it appears blur to our eyes. So, it must be the right amount of blur.

To tackle this problem, we add motion blur to make it look more natural and reality based. It provides the natural smearing we see when something moves too quickly but not when shooting the video. To add this effect, you can use powerful editing software such as Wondershare Filmora. Follow the below steps to add a blur effect to your video on Filmora.

## Part4: Motion Blur Effect in Filmmaking

Motion Blur is one of the essential effects to add when you are making a movie. It exaggerates the motion in a perfect way which is necessary for most action movies. This blur effect is usually the result of something moving quicker than the camera. The more significant the speed difference between the camera filming and the moving object, the more pronounced motion blur will be.

In the majority of the cases, it is best to apply motion blur on background objects than the subjects. For example, motion blur is perfect for the shots in which the camera moves at the same speed as the subject. Although, if the subject is moving faster than the camera, you would want a minimal blur.

Technically speaking, more excellent motion blur can be obtained through a lower shutter speed or vice versa. Ensure that your shutter speed is always twice your framerate because anything lower can result in unnatural-looking footage. The famous bike chase of Star Wars Episode VI is a perfect example of the productive application of motion blur. The scene was captured by walking in the forest and shooting a single frame per time.

## Conclusion

Most of the videos need a significant amount of blur to make them look realistic. FCPX is excellent editing software, but it does not have blurring effects. However, there's a way to add blur effect in FCPX, but many people are unaware of it.

To tackle this problem, we came up with different plugins for Motion Blur and its effects in filmmaking. So, now you have in-depth knowledge of how you can add blur effects in FCPX.

Technically speaking, more excellent motion blur can be obtained through a lower shutter speed or vice versa. Ensure that your shutter speed is always twice your framerate because anything lower can result in unnatural-looking footage. The famous bike chase of Star Wars Episode VI is a perfect example of the productive application of motion blur. The scene was captured by walking in the forest and shooting a single frame per time.

## Conclusion

Most of the videos need a significant amount of blur to make them look realistic. FCPX is excellent editing software, but it does not have blurring effects. However, there's a way to add blur effect in FCPX, but many people are unaware of it.

To tackle this problem, we came up with different plugins for Motion Blur and its effects in filmmaking. So, now you have in-depth knowledge of how you can add blur effects in FCPX.

## Part4: Motion Blur Effect in Filmmaking

Motion Blur is one of the essential effects to add when you are making a movie. It exaggerates the motion in a perfect way which is necessary for most action movies. This blur effect is usually the result of something moving quicker than the camera. The more significant the speed difference between the camera filming and the moving object, the more pronounced motion blur will be.

In the majority of the cases, it is best to apply motion blur on background objects than the subjects. For example, motion blur is perfect for the shots in which the camera moves at the same speed as the subject. Although, if the subject is moving faster than the camera, you would want a minimal blur.

Technically speaking, more excellent motion blur can be obtained through a lower shutter speed or vice versa. Ensure that your shutter speed is always twice your framerate because anything lower can result in unnatural-looking footage. The famous bike chase of Star Wars Episode VI is a perfect example of the productive application of motion blur. The scene was captured by walking in the forest and shooting a single frame per time.
