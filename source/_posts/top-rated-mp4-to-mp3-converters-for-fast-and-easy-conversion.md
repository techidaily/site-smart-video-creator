 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The MP4 file format is probably the most commonly used video file format today, as various video recording devices use it as the default video file format. The duration of a video and the resolution in which a video was captured determine its size, so the size of an MP4 file can vary between a couple of hundred of megabytes to a couple of gigabytes. That’s why there is no reason to store huge MP4 files if you only need their audio since converting this type of file to an MP3 file format is a simple process. Read on if you would like to learn more about the best MP4 to MP3 converters you can use online or on PC and Mac computers.

## Best Mac and PC-based MP4 to MP3 Converters

Both Mac and PC users have a broad range of free software products at their disposal that enable them to convert MP4 video file to MP3 audio files. So, let's take a look at some of the easiest ways to turn MP4 to MP3 on a Mac or a PC.

The built-in library of royalty-free music and audio effects enables you to create compelling soundtracks for each of your videos, while its Denoise feature helps you reduce background noise in audio files.
