## Part 1: 4 Best Video Resume Makers

From a technical standpoint, creating a video resume isn’t much different from making any other [type of video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), since you are going to need a webcam, a [video camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), or a screen recording software to capture the footage and [video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to piece the footage together.

## Part 2: What should be included in a video resume?

In essence, there is no difference between a video resume and a paper resume, which are means of obtaining an interview. So, in the video resume, the following information should be included as well:

**Education background:** When recording video resumes, briefly introduce the educational experience and qualifications, the majors and graduates, and the specific skills and abilities if necessary.

**Work experience:** Focus on past jobs and positions and achievements.

**Training experience:** What kind of skills training did you participate in, and what benefits do you get from it?

**Job intention:** which position you’re applying for, and why do you want to this job. You can state it from your majors and your future career plans.

**Concluding remarks:**  you can end your resume recording with sentences like Thank you for watching my resume and looking forward to the opportunity to get an interview.

## Part 4: Tips That Are Going to Help You Make a Better Video Resume

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take –** Don’t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more –** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Don’t improvise, make a script –** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what you’re good at –** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, don’t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Don’t forget your audience –** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they don’t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.
