Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

#### In this article

01 [What is HD Video?](#Part 1)

02 [What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?](#Part 2)

03 [Video Resolution and Corresponding File Sizes?](#Part 3)

04 [Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?](#Part 4)

05 [Is HD 2K or 1K?](#Part 5)

06 [How to Change Video Resolution Easily?](#Part 6)

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

![File Size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-2.jpg)

## Part 4 Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?

* 720p is also popular with the name HD (high-definition). It is a display resolution that measures 1280 x 720 pixels.
* 480p often known as Standard Definition (SD). It usually starts at 240 p and ends at 480 p. So, 480 p is a semi-HD.
* 960 X 480 p is a progressive camera scan format usually used in surveillance cameras, webcams, or action POV cams. It adds a wide horizontal view as compared to the standard definition. But it is less than HD.

## Part 5 Is HD 2K or 1K?

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

So with a size of 1080 pixels, the corresponding width of 1920 pixels uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

![File Size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-2.jpg)

## Part 4 Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?

* 720p is also popular with the name HD (high-definition). It is a display resolution that measures 1280 x 720 pixels.
* 480p often known as Standard Definition (SD). It usually starts at 240 p and ends at 480 p. So, 480 p is a semi-HD.
* 960 X 480 p is a progressive camera scan format usually used in surveillance cameras, webcams, or action POV cams. It adds a wide horizontal view as compared to the standard definition. But it is less than HD.

## Part 5 Is HD 2K or 1K?

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

If you are a fan of electronic, noise, and other experimental genres of music that emerged in the early and mid-1990s, then you probably already know what Glitch art is. Those of you who are a bit younger and don’t know the VJ-ing scene well, have probably encountered glitch art through music videos released by bands like The Glitch Mob or Gorrilaz. Even though intentionally creating glitches and distortions that look like they were caused by hardware malfunction used to be a complex and highly technical process, video editing apps that appeared on the market in the last couple of years have made this video technique almost automatic. If you would like to create glitch art, but you’re not sure where to start, you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through the ten **best glitch art video editing apps for iOS and Android**.

## 10 Best Glitch Art Video Editing Apps for iOS and Android-based Devices

Besides, stunning glitch art effects, nearly all apps we featured in this article are also equipped with powerful video editing tools you can use to manipulate the footage you’ve captured with your phone in any way you want. So, let’s take a look at some of the best glitch art video editing apps for iOS and Android devices.

#### 1. [GlitchFX](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glitch-video-effects-glitchfx/id1360624861?mt=8)

![glitchFX-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitchFX-poster.jpg)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

Making music videos with the GlitchFX app is fun and easy since you only have to pick a video you’d like to edit from your phone’s camera roll, choose the song you’d like to use as a soundtrack, and apply a VHS, Glitch, or any other visual effect you like. The app also features Cut and Trim tools that let you remove all parts of the selected video you don’t want to include in the final cut of your glitch art video. GlicthFX’s file-sharing capabilities present you with a number of options as you can post your latest creations on Musical.ly, Facebook, YouTube, and other popular social networks directly from the app. The only downside is that you have to make in-app purchases in order to be able to use all the VHS and glitch effects the app has to offer.

#### 2. [Glitch Video Effects](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zlogic.glitchee&hl=en)

![glitch-video-effects-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitch-video-effects-poster.png)

**Price:** Free, but contains ads

**Compatibility:** Android

If you are a fan of vaporwave aesthetics and you like making experimental mind-bending videos, then this Android-based app might be the right choice for you. The app lets you capture glitch photos and videos in real-time, so you can see how your images are going to look like even before you press the record button. There are more than a hundred trippy and glitch video effects you can choose from that enable you to recreate some vintage styles of videos or make unique videos with hallucinogenic colors. When done experimenting, you can share your Glitch art videos with your friends on social media with a single tap.

#### 3. [Groovo](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/groovo-video-effects-glitch/id1283795125?mt=8)

![groovo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/groovo.png)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buzzmusiq.groovo&hl=en), iOS

Groovo is a community of like-minded people where you can discover new content on a daily basis and find inspiration for your own work. This AI-powered app grants you access to huge music and visual effects libraries, which enables you to create stunning music videos effortlessly. Groovo also features basic video editing tools, so you can remove all parts of the audio or video files you don’t want to share with your friends on social media. What’s more, all the videos you create with Groovo are going to be watermark-free, but you shouldn’t expect too much from this app in terms of its video editing capabilities.

#### 4. [Glitché](https://glitche.com/)

![glitche-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitche-poster.png)

**Price:** $0,99, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

Ariana Grande, Kylie Jenner or Travis Scott are just a few among countless celebrities who are already using this app to take photos or capture videos. Glitché offers a rich selection of real-time photo and video filters you can control even while you’re still recording. There are more than 30 creative tools that let you create VHS style videos or make digital glitches in just a few simple taps, and if you want to edit your photos and videos with a more powerful software you can export your projects to Adobe Creative Cloud. However, you are going to have to make a few in-app purchases if you want to have access to all of the app’s features.

#### 5. [HYPERSPECTIVE](https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/hyperspektiv/id1058051662?mt=8)

![hyperspektiv-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperspektiv-poster.png)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

There is so much more you can do with this app, besides creating glitch art, because even the free version HYPERSPECTIVE offers a powerful mirroring system and a rich selection of visual effects. In order to be able to record videos for your Instagram stories, you must upgrade to the paid version of the app that lets you capture HD videos and adjust their bitrate. In addition, the app suggests the content you can use as a source of inspiration for your work, so you can never run out of the ideas for your next video. HYPERSPECTIVE’s exporting capabilities, however, leave much to be desired for.

#### 6. [Glitch Wizard](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glitch-wizard-distort-photos-to-trippy-gifs/id904640439?mt=8)

![glitchwizard-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitchwizard-poster.png)

**Price:** $1,99

**Compatibility:** iOS

The app offers more than thirty glitches you can use to create different styles of glitch art videos. You can try out different options and once you get the result you like you can export it as a GIF or a short video. However, Glitch Wizard doesn’t offer video editing options, so there isn’t much more you can do with it other than experiment with different glitches. Even so, this app is an excellent choice for all glitch video artists in need of a creative tool that lets them produce amazing visuals effortlessly. Adding the glitchwizard hashtag to your creations can help you become one of the app’s featured artists.

#### 7. [Glitch!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lucagrillo.ImageGlitcher&hl=en%5FUS)

![glitch-1-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitch-1-poster.png)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** Android

Even though Glitch! is primarily a photo editing app, you can still use it to generate both GIF and MP4 animations. All you have to do in order to create a glitch photo is to select a picture from your phone’s gallery, upload it into the app and choose the effect you like the most. Afterward, you just have to set the X and Y values that determine how many errors your picture is going to contain and proceed to share it on social media. Keep in mind that some of the app’s advanced features have to be purchased before you can use them to create your artwork.

#### 9. [Glitch Cam – Video Effects](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glitch-cam-video-effects/id1447083274?mt=8)

![glitchcam-videoeffects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitchcam-videoeffects.png)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

Recording glitch art masterpieces is going to become so easy if you install the Glitch Cam because this app provides you with a ridiculous amount of effects you can combine in real time. In addition to stunning glitch effects, the app is also equipped with a VHS Camcorder that lets you make vintage videos that look like they’re recorded in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The best part is that you can export all your creations in full HD resolution and share them to your favorite social networks directly from the app in just a few quick taps.

#### 10. [KineMaster](https://www.kinemaster.com/)

![kinemaster-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kinemaster-poster.png)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kinemaster-video-editor/id1223932558), Android

Before you can start creating a glitch video with KineMaster, you must first install the Anaglyph Slide effect from the app’s Asset Store. Once the effect is installed, you can import the file you’d like to edit and proceed to make cuts, apply transitions or add a voiceover. When you complete all other [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) actions, you should head over to the Effects menu in order to apply the Anaglyph Slide effect to the video. You can then adjust the effect’s settings by assigning new Angle, Speed, and Distance values and that’s it you’ve created a glitch video with KineMaster.
