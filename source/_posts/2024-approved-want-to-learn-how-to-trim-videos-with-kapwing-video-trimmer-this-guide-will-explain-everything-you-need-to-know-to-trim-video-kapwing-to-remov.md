## Part 2: What is Video Tag, and why should you use it?

The <video> tag lets you insert video content or a media player in a document, for example, to embed a movie clip or other different video streams. The video tag includes one or more <source> tags with various video sources, and the browser will select the source it supports.

Do you know why to use these tags? The video tags are illustrative keywords that can add to the video to help viewers search the content. Further, video tags are contemplated as an important ranking factor in algorithm and YouTube's search. Most importantly, video tags give information about your video to Google search and YouTube, such as your video's category, topic, note boundaries, and more. Further, video tags allow you to arrange and manage files easily, plus sort and search the target video file promptly.

**Conclusion:**

To ensure safety and security, we need some special tools to edit audio or video metadata. For this purpose, video tag editors are used for editing all common format audio and video files. The MP4 video tag editors enable you to manage and alter the music arts plus sort out the multimedia files. So, if you want to edit video metadata tags on your Mac or Windows, you need specific software. For your convenience, here we've listed the top 10 best **mp4 metadata editors**.

Let's see which websites you can use to download the intro and title templates for Premiere Pro.

### 16. [Motion Array](https://motionarray.com/browse)

In addition to an impressive library of intro templates, Motion Array offers presets, sound effects, royalty-free music, and stock footage.

The website provides you with powerful search tools, so you can select the resolution of the template, up to 8K, or choose which types of templates are going to be displayed.

Using the free subscription plan can limit your options since you'll only be able to download free templates, and your upload storage will be limited to just 1GB.

The Pro subscription plan that can be purchased for $54 per month will grant you access to an almost endless selection of title templates as well as a huge selection of plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Motion-Array.jpg)

### 17. [Cinecom – Simple Intro for Premiere Pro](https://www.cinecom.net/designer-packs/simple-titles-for-premiere-pro/)

Once you've installed all the fonts from the library, you can use them to replace the software's default library. You just have to click on the Replace Style Library option that can be accessed from Premiere Pro's Title Style tab.

If you don't feel comfortable creating your titles or if you simply don't have the time to create your own titles, the Free Cinematic Style Library is not the best choice for you.

The website provides you with powerful search tools, so you can select the resolution of the template, up to 8K, or choose which types of templates are going to be displayed.

Using the free subscription plan can limit your options since you'll only be able to download free templates, and your upload storage will be limited to just 1GB.

The Pro subscription plan that can be purchased for $54 per month will grant you access to an almost endless selection of title templates as well as a huge selection of plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Motion-Array.jpg)
