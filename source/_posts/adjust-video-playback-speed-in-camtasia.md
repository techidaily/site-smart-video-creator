**Pros**: JayCut does all you could imagine in a single web page. Actually, it amazes me and my friends. I like everything about this website. It is very user friendly and allows you to upload different types of media very quickly, and then mix them together. The mixing becomes more of a work of art and one feels a sense of ownership when then have added titles, transitions and music to their pictures or video. Lastly I really like the fact that each person creates his or her own profile page. The profile makes it a fun way of learning about other people and it can be fun because it is similar to Facebook or Myspace.

**Cons:** If people would expect more, maybe the develop team could add more transitions and text effects, and suit the needs to export to facebook and a choice to select DVD service.

**Conclusion:** Jaycut is a quick and easy-to-use website video editor. It's fun and interactive. The design is so intuitive that people could easily understand how to use everything the website offers.

## Enhance Your Videos: Best Brightening Apps for Mobile

##### Adjust Video Color and Brightness Easily

When photographing with an iPhone or Android device, you may encounter a variety of lighting issues. If you record them in a dim setting, you may find that your movies are excessively dark or of low quality. Recording in low-light conditions may result in a too gloomy video to see clearly and may potentially degrade video quality.

In such cases, utilizing video brightening software on an iPhone or Android might be one of the greatest ways to brighten a video. In addition, we've compiled a list of **Video Brightening Editor App** programs for you on this page. Carefully read the information below to learn more about their characteristics, supported operating systems, and more!

#### In this article

02 [How to Brighten a Video on Your iPhone Before or While Recording](#part2)

## Part 1: Best Video Editing Apps to Edit Brightness on iPhone and Android

Brightness is important in a clip, whether you realize it or not. Viewers would not sit through a dark video in which they can't see anything. You need the right amount of brightness in your film to make it more engaging and eye-catching. And the apps we've looked at below can help you do just that.

### 1\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a video brightening editing tool made specifically for cellphones. It's simple to use, and even beginners can use it to edit films. Filmora enhances the video's brightness, making it crisper and more vivid.

This application's features include capturing clips, cutting them, adding background music, applying overlays and effects, and more. This popular program also supports Ultra HD resolution. Filmora includes several powerful tools that enable you to put even the most unique and creative ideas into action.

You may make movies, work on music videos, and share the finished products with your pals. This software saves you time while still providing entertainment!

To brighten a video, simply get the app on your phone and install it. Launch the app and select the "+" button to add the video you wish to modify. By clicking on the 5-second mark in the menu settings, you may alter the video's brightness. Click on the "Export" button to save the altered video for later use.

### 2\. [Capcut](https://www.capcut.net/)

Number second on our list is the Capcut video editor that users have grown absolutely fond of. After testing both the Android and iOS versions of CapCut, we discovered that the software is extremely user-friendly and provides many useful features tailored to TikTok users.

Split-screen, vintage, humorous, dreamy, party, and so on are just a few of the various effects available. Those effects add new components to your video, giving it the appearance of being professionally edited. You'll discover sub-categories of effects inside each of these categories, allowing you to fine-tune your changes to obtain the precise one that's suitable for that clip.

To brighten a video, simply tap on the "+" feature in the new Project tab. Import your video. Head over to the Edit section and apply Brightness from the Adjustment section.

### 3\. iMovie

For iPhone and iPad owners, iMovie is the app of choice. YouTubers who wish to edit videos on their phones often use the iOS video editing software. It combines a user-friendly interface with fast performance, ensuring that visual content is never compromised while using a free video editor.

It offers 4K and multi-track editing, a variety of filters, and the ability to incorporate free music that adapts to the duration of a film. To master the iMovie learning curve, you don't need to be an expert in video processing. iMovie's theme library is one of the most prominent features. Each choice includes music, transitions, and text overlays, allowing you to save time and effort when editing.

### 4\. [InShot](https://inshot.com/)

InShot provides all of the options you'll need to improve the quality of your recordings with the brighten video software. Because this is an all-encompassing software, it gives a lot of flexibility and features. InShot will assist you with creating movies, flipping and rotating film, adjusting music playback speed, and applying filters.
