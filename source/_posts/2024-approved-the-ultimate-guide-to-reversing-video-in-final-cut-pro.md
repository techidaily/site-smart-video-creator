#### **Difference between Rewind and Reverse:**

#### **Reverse:**

The word reverse as the name reflects, means that we can play a video from its end towards the initial position. Yes, it is possible to reverse the order of video frames in order to arrange them in such a way that last frame appears first following the reverse sequence so that first frame goes to the last position in the clip.

#### **Rewind:**

On the other side rewind is also an interesting feature for video editing where users simply duplicate the clip in form of a segment or make adjustments over range selection and then rewind that particular segment at a speed many times faster than the original speed of clip. After this they play segment of original clip in normal speed towards forward direction.

Although it is possible to get the rewind effect in videos with simple reverse option but still Apple platform supports both of these as standalone options.

## How to reverse a clip in Final Cut Pro

We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.

## Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

Even though selecting a video collage app isn’t a very complicated process, there are still a number of factors you need to consider before you choose to install a video collage app on your iPad or iPhone. Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.

You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage.

This web-based platform enables anyone to create whiteboard animations that can be used in both professional and academic contexts. In fact, anyone can create a compelling white animation with VideoScribe in just three simple steps.

After selecting the images from the platform’s library or uploading your own material and adding text, voiceovers, and music, VideoScribe will generate a whiteboard animation for you. This online platform offers an easy way to introduce your children to the world of animation and enables them to create animations from the images they create. Each whiteboard animation your child makes with VideoScribe can be shared to YouTube or Vimeo, but you should keep in mind that all animations created with the free version of this app are going to be watermarked.

**Pros**

* The image library contains more than 6000 royalty-free images
* VideoScribe lets its users record voiceovers
* Equipped with a broad range of hand, pens and other pre-animated elements
* Excellent file-sharing capabilities

**Cons**

* VideoScribe doesn’t offer any video editing tools
* Removing watermark requires you to update to the pro version of the app

**Conclusion**

Encouraging your children to express their creativity can be beneficial for a variety of reasons. A video editing software like Filmora is one of your best choices if your child wants to create YouTube videos, while iOS and Android-based apps like Filmora or The Lego Movie 2 Movie Maker are well-suited for all children who would like to create videos from their Smartphones. Which of the best video editing apps for kids are you going to get for your child? Leave a comment and let us know.
