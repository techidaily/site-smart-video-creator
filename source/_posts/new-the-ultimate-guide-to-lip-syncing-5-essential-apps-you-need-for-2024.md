You don’t have to be a music prodigy to create an amazing music video, you don’t even have to know how to sing, because there are hundreds of iOS and Android-based apps that let you create a lip sync video. The only important thing is to move your lips and appear to be saying the same words at the exact same moment as the real singer of the song you’re covering. **Lip syncing** allows you to focus on your dancing or any other action you’re planning on doing in a video and reduces the need to perform a song perfectly.

**Lip sync videos** are a great source of fun, and producing them doesn’t require you to have a professional video or sound equipment. In this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the **best lip sync apps on iPhone and Android phones**, and we are going to show you **how to use them to create amazing lip sync videos**.

## Making Lip Sync Videos with 5 Best Lip Sync Apps

Lip syncing seems easier than it actually is because synchronizing the movement of your lips with the lyrics of a song can prove to be a challenging task. If the first take doesn’t turn out the way you wanted, keep trying because the practice is one of the most important aspects of creating a great lip sync video.

#### 1. TikTok

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ro/app/tiktok/id835599320?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.ugc.trill&hl=en%5FUS)

In a little over two years, TikTok has become one of the largest platforms for music videos in the world after the acquisition of Musical.ly. Currently, the app **has over 150 million daily users** and the TikTok community keeps growing at an astounding rate. You can **browse through the latest videos** on the platform or **upload your own videos**.

The **+** icon located near the bottom of the screen grants you access to the **video recording** options. To access the TikTok’s library of songs you just have to tap on the **Pick a Sound** option and select the song you want to use in your video. As you tap on a song, a **Shoot with this sound** option will appear on the screen, tap on it to begin recording a video. The **scissors icon** can be used to **set the start and end points of a song**, while the menu near the bottom of the screen lets you choose **how fast the playback** of the song is going to be. Hit the **Record** button to start making your new lip sync video and once the recording session is over hit the **Post** icon to share the video on the TikTok platform.

#### 2. Triller

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.triller.droid&hl=en)

The incredibly rich music library, this app offers makes it a perfect choice for anyone who wants to create a lip sync video. Like TikTok, Triller is also a social video community that lets you like, comment or share videos other users posted on the platform. Recording a video with this app is easy since you just have to choose a song, set its duration, and hit the record button. The duration of all songs in the Triller’s music library is limited to just 30 seconds, and if you want to make a longer lip sync video, you have to upload a song from your device.

Tapping the Capture button will start the video recording session and while you’re recording you can zoom in or zoom out in order to change the composition of the shot. The app’s auto editing algorithm will render the video after you stop recording, but you can still add emojis, stickers or filters to each lip sync video you create with this app, by selecting the Re Edit option. The videos you produce with this app can be shared on all of the most popular social media or on the Triller platform

#### 3. [Dubsmash](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dubsmash-lip-sync-dance/id918820076?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

This video messaging app hosts one of the world’s largest sound and music libraries, so in addition to creating lip sync music videos you can also lip sync over the famous movie and TV show quotes. The app’s users can search for inspiration by browsing through the videos Dubmashers share on the platform or they can upload their own content.

In order to make your first video with Dubmash you just have to choose a song or a sound and hit the Record button. You can also upload your own music and sound to the app and share them with the app’s users. After you’ve captured a lip sync video you can add text effects, apply filters or stickers to make it even more amusing. The Download option lets you save your videos to your phone, while the green arrow button enables you to send videos to your friends or post them on your social media accounts.

#### 4. [StarMaker](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/starmaker-sing-karaoke-songs/id342138881?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

The process of creating lip sync videos with this app is simple, as you just have to find a song, fine-tune audio and video settings and tap the Start button to get the video recording session underway. You can use the live streaming feature if you want to showcase your vocal skills instead of making a lip sync video or use the app’s collection of audio and video effects to make your recordings more beautiful. StarMaker lets you share your creations wherever you want, with a few simple taps.

#### 5. [Funimate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avcrbt.funimate&hl=en)
