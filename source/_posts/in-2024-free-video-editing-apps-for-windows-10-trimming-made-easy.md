That’s why choosing the Unlimited, Professional, or Business subscription plans that have no publish time or cloud storage restrictions is a much better option.

Moreover, if you opt for either of these plans, you will be able to export all of your videos in 4K resolution and you’ll have access to premium video editing tools.

**Pros:**

* Rich stock footage libraries
* Allows users to export audio files
* Offers screencasting tools
* Provides social media marketing options

**Cons:**

* Limited social sharing capabilities
* Adjusting a video’s frame rate is only possible if you purchase the Business subscription plan

### Conclusion

Finding an online alternative to iMovie isn’t difficult, because there are a lot of web-based video editing platforms that enable you to perform simple video editing tasks.

Nonetheless, the free versions of online video editors often offer a limited scope of the tools you need to create videos that can attract the attention of online audiences. Still, each of the video editing platform we included in this article can be used to create different types of videos. Which of the five best free iMovie alternatives are you going to choose?

## Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?

As already mentioned, a picture size ratio refers to calculating or determining the Ratio of an image. And, it's accomplished by using a**picture ratio** **calculator**. So, for example, the picture size ratio could vary from 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.

You can visualize this aspect ratio by allocating an image's width and height units. For example, a 6×4 inch image has a 3:2 aspect ratio, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video includes a 16:9 aspect ratio.

**Fact Check:**

An aspect ratio does not contain attached units—instead, it shows how large the width compared to the height, meaning that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if measured in inches.

The relationship between its height and width decides the shape and Ratio instead of the image's actual size.

Different aspect ratios consist of varying effects on the image you use. For example, an image set in a 1:1 ratio vs. a 5:4 ratio changes the composition and perception of the photo.

**Types of picture size ratios**

**1:1 Ratio**

![1:1 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-2.jpg)

A 1:1 ratio includes an image's width and height are square and thus equal. Some standard 1:1 ratios are an 8″x8″ photo, a 1080 x 1080 pixel image generally used for mobile screens, print photographs, and social media platforms.

**3:2 Ratio**

![3:2 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-3.jpg)

The 3:2 Ratio is generally 35mm film and photography and is still extensively used for prints. Images framed at 6″x4″ or 1080×720 pixels set within this aspect ratio.

**5:4 Ratio**

![5:4 Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-4.jpg)

Last but not least, this Ratio is standard in photography and art prints and photography.

In the following sections, let's uncover more about the photo aspect ratio and its related calculator!

## Part 2 What is 1920x1080 in Ratio?

![1920x1080 in Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-5.jpg)

1920 x 1080 is itself a 16:9 aspect ratio. By default, DSLRs, smartphones, and most modern camcorders record video at 1920 x 1080.

## Part 3 How Do You Find the Ratio of an Image?

Before finding the image ratio, understand that there's a difference between image size and image ratio.

Unlike aspect ratios, image size shows the actual width and height in pixels. Image size refers to the image dimensions. You can measure its dimensions in any unit, but you'll generally see pixels used for digital or web images and inches used for print images.

It's essential to note that two different images containing the same aspect ratio may not have the exact dimensions of an image. For instance, the image has 1920×1080 pixels has 16:9 aspect ratios, and an image sized at 1280×720 pixels has a 16:9 aspect ratio.

You can use this[tool](https://calculateaspectratio.com/)to measure the aspect ratio of images. Here, match either ratio width and ratio and height or pixel width and pixel height to find the aspect ratio in this**image size ratio calculator**.

## Part 4 1920x1080 Aspect Ratio and 16:9 Aspect Ratio Differences

These are almost the same. The only difference is that of the pixels. If you cancel the numbers 1920 and 1080, they will automatically come as 16 and 9\. 1920 x 1080 is a 16:9 aspect ratio.

## Part 5 The Resolution Calculator (Image Ratio Calculator)

To use a picture aspect ratio calculator, you need to understand the following.

Understand the following five variables:

**●** H1 Height of the initial image

**●** W1 Width of the initial image

**●** H2 Height of the final image

**●** W2 Width of the final image

**●** A percentage - the proportion of the initial image's ratio to the final image's ratio.

The aspect ratio formulas that sync the quantities mentioned above for the ratio converter are:

**H1/W1 = H2/W2,**

**H1 \* A% = H2, and**

**W1 \* A% = W2**

You are not required to understand the details by heart; if the initial resolution is generally used, use the list to select the ideal ratio:

**Proportions**

**●** 4:3,

**●** 3:2,

**●** 16:9,

**●** 16:10,

**●** 1:1, square, in some social networks,

**●** 85:1,

**Pixels**

**●** 2048:1536, iPad with Retina screen;

**●** 1920:1080, HD TV, iPhone 6 plus; and

**●** 800:600, traditional television & computer monitor standard.

## Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?

As already mentioned, a picture size ratio refers to calculating or determining the Ratio of an image. And, it's accomplished by using a**picture ratio** **calculator**. So, for example, the picture size ratio could vary from 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.

You can visualize this aspect ratio by allocating an image's width and height units. For example, a 6×4 inch image has a 3:2 aspect ratio, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video includes a 16:9 aspect ratio.

**Fact Check:**

An aspect ratio does not contain attached units—instead, it shows how large the width compared to the height, meaning that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if measured in inches.

The relationship between its height and width decides the shape and Ratio instead of the image's actual size.

Different aspect ratios consist of varying effects on the image you use. For example, an image set in a 1:1 ratio vs. a 5:4 ratio changes the composition and perception of the photo.

**Types of picture size ratios**

**1:1 Ratio**

![1:1 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-2.jpg)

A 1:1 ratio includes an image's width and height are square and thus equal. Some standard 1:1 ratios are an 8″x8″ photo, a 1080 x 1080 pixel image generally used for mobile screens, print photographs, and social media platforms.

**3:2 Ratio**

![3:2 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-3.jpg)

The 3:2 Ratio is generally 35mm film and photography and is still extensively used for prints. Images framed at 6″x4″ or 1080×720 pixels set within this aspect ratio.

**5:4 Ratio**

![5:4 Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-4.jpg)

Last but not least, this Ratio is standard in photography and art prints and photography.

In the following sections, let's uncover more about the photo aspect ratio and its related calculator!

## Part 2 What is 1920x1080 in Ratio?

![1920x1080 in Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-5.jpg)

1920 x 1080 is itself a 16:9 aspect ratio. By default, DSLRs, smartphones, and most modern camcorders record video at 1920 x 1080.

## Part 3 How Do You Find the Ratio of an Image?

Before finding the image ratio, understand that there's a difference between image size and image ratio.

Unlike aspect ratios, image size shows the actual width and height in pixels. Image size refers to the image dimensions. You can measure its dimensions in any unit, but you'll generally see pixels used for digital or web images and inches used for print images.

It's essential to note that two different images containing the same aspect ratio may not have the exact dimensions of an image. For instance, the image has 1920×1080 pixels has 16:9 aspect ratios, and an image sized at 1280×720 pixels has a 16:9 aspect ratio.

You can use this[tool](https://calculateaspectratio.com/)to measure the aspect ratio of images. Here, match either ratio width and ratio and height or pixel width and pixel height to find the aspect ratio in this**image size ratio calculator**.

## Part 4 1920x1080 Aspect Ratio and 16:9 Aspect Ratio Differences

These are almost the same. The only difference is that of the pixels. If you cancel the numbers 1920 and 1080, they will automatically come as 16 and 9\. 1920 x 1080 is a 16:9 aspect ratio.

## Part 5 The Resolution Calculator (Image Ratio Calculator)

To use a picture aspect ratio calculator, you need to understand the following.

Understand the following five variables:

**●** H1 Height of the initial image

**●** W1 Width of the initial image

**●** H2 Height of the final image

**●** W2 Width of the final image

**●** A percentage - the proportion of the initial image's ratio to the final image's ratio.

The aspect ratio formulas that sync the quantities mentioned above for the ratio converter are:

**H1/W1 = H2/W2,**

**H1 \* A% = H2, and**

**W1 \* A% = W2**

You are not required to understand the details by heart; if the initial resolution is generally used, use the list to select the ideal ratio:

**Proportions**

**●** 4:3,

**●** 3:2,

**●** 16:9,

**●** 16:10,

**●** 1:1, square, in some social networks,

**●** 85:1,

**Pixels**

**●** 2048:1536, iPad with Retina screen;

**●** 1920:1080, HD TV, iPhone 6 plus; and

**●** 800:600, traditional television & computer monitor standard.

The most standard aspect ratios of videos are 4:3 and 16:9\. Despite these two, 9:16 and 1:1 get famous over social media platforms these days.

As far as you may know, various media players help you to transform the aspect ratio in real-time when playback. Yet this modification is temporary. You are required to change the aspect ratio again next time you open them.

But, changing the aspect ratios is pretty different than other media players. You need to launch the program and create a new project simply. But, before you do a new project, you can easily change it at the beginning panel.

The Filmora assists you in changing the aspect ratio of the project after downloading. Hit the drop-down tab, and you will choose the options among 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16, and 21:9 aspect ratios.
