It's an age-old battle, [Vegas](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/) or [Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer's own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. Here we aim to lay out the specifications of each product and discuss their effects on workflow, output, and usability to form an opinion beyond the 'this is the one I like' argument. However, we are aware of making a completely fair comparison is impossible. We will try our best. Hope you will enjoy it!

Again the [Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html), and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of 'things', so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere's more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.

Underneath the [Vegas specifications](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/) though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.

I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is [the major difference for new users](https://www.udemy.com/). This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe's own online video education for the software.

#### 2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison

As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. [Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows](https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases), and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn't even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.

It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn't tell the whole story, with the audio and [effect modules more advanced in Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html), however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.

#### 3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison

Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of [media formats](https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html) \- of Adobe's product makes it a superior product for long-term use.

The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.

#### 4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison

There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe's strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and [in the case of video effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.

## Part 2: FAQ about Vegas

### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.

It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW [Digital Audio Workstation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.

A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.

I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.

Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.

### 2\. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?

No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.

Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.

Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas â€˜Proâ€™ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.

Both come at a premium cost anyway.

### 3\. How much does Sony Vegas cost?

There are [different plans of the Sony Vegas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698\. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898\. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.

So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output. For anyone looking for more than just an editor, it is the choice to make. Find some instructional material, dive in, and have fun.

Again the [Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html), and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of 'things', so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere's more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.

Underneath the [Vegas specifications](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/) though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.

I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is [the major difference for new users](https://www.udemy.com/). This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe's own online video education for the software.

#### 2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison

As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. [Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows](https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases), and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn't even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.

It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn't tell the whole story, with the audio and [effect modules more advanced in Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html), however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.

#### 3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison

Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of [media formats](https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html) \- of Adobe's product makes it a superior product for long-term use.

The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.

#### 4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison

There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe's strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and [in the case of video effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.

## Part 2: FAQ about Vegas

### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.

It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW [Digital Audio Workstation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.

A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.

I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.

Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.

### 2\. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?

No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.

Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.

Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas â€˜Proâ€™ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.

Both come at a premium cost anyway.

### 3\. How much does Sony Vegas cost?

There are [different plans of the Sony Vegas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698\. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898\. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.

So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output. For anyone looking for more than just an editor, it is the choice to make. Find some instructional material, dive in, and have fun.

It's an age-old battle, [Vegas](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/) or [Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer's own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. Here we aim to lay out the specifications of each product and discuss their effects on workflow, output, and usability to form an opinion beyond the 'this is the one I like' argument. However, we are aware of making a completely fair comparison is impossible. We will try our best. Hope you will enjoy it!

# System Requirements for Running Premiere Pro: How to Set Up Computer

We all know that [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) is one of the best professional video editing software, while to run such a powerful video editing software, you may need a powerful windows PC or Mac as well. Though most modern computer systems can run Adobe Premiere out of the box, there are some steps to take, and potential decisions to make, before installing the software, or if you are building or buying a new computer to make sure you get the best experience possible with the software.

## Minimum system requirement to run Premiere Pro on Windows and Mac in 2019

Your computer should at least to meet **the minimum specification** below to run Premiere Pro, and if you need to edit some VR videos, your computer configuration should be higher according to [the minimum specifications list on their website](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html).

* Intel 6th or newer **CPU**
* Windows 10 (64-bit) 1703 or later/ MacOS V10.12 later
* **16GB RAM**; 4GB GPU VRAM
* Fast internal SSD
* 1920\*1080 **Display resolution**
* 32-bit **video card**
* **Internet connection**

However, it is important to remember this is the minimum specification, and will not necessarily give a satisfactory user experience. The recommended specifications are far more likely to provide the kind of performance expected of the software and those would be the ones to use as a guide for the minimum spec for a new computer or any upgrades being planned prior to installation.

## How to check Computer Specifications

Since Premiere Pro CC only works on Windows 10 system after 2018 13.0 release, we will show you how to check if your PC meets the requirements to run Premiere Pro on Windows 10

* Press **Windows Key+ E** on the keyboard to bring up **Windows Explorer**.
* Right click the **This PC** option in the sidebar and then select **Properties** from the context menu.

![check PC system](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/check-system-requirements.jpg)

* The system specification window will show up which you see the **Processor**, RAM, system type and other system information.

Checking the specification on your Mac is easy, just click the **Apple icon** in the top-left corner of your Mac, and then select **About This Mac** option. In the pop-up window you will see the information including Processor speed, memory and graphic card etc.

## How to Set Up Computer for Premiere

#### 1\. Processor

Whilst the software will run on a Core2Duo intel or Phenom II AMD processor, it is worth noting that [rendering can be highly intensive work for the processor](https://www.cgdirector.com/best-cpu-for-rendering/) and the fastest possible processor within your budget will pay dividends in speed of editing. In general, even a Core I3, the cheapest of the current Intel range, will be significantly faster than older processors, but because Premiere happily uses multi cored processors to their full, if the budget can reach to a quad core or more processor then do so, Premiere is a piece of software that benefits from the computational power increase more than most.

#### 2\. Memory

The next consideration is memory. The minimum specification suggests 4GB of RAM with 8GB recommended, for reliable and smooth running consider 8GB minimum, and go for as much as you can. For a computer that is used for other activities as well, multitasking can see even 24GB of Ram being fully utilized, especially if you are working on HD content. Speaking of content, this is the other aspect of memory to look at. Whilst you can use a storage drive that contains everything else on your computer to keep the media you are working on, for HD content especially, and for trouble free and the fastest possible operation it is advisable to reserve a single drive, preferably a 7200 RPM or faster one, exclusively for your media. Bandwidth and access times means Premiere will be significantly faster in operation with its media on a dedicated drive.

#### 3\. Graphic

The final aspect of specification to consider is graphics. Adobe Premiere uses a feature called the Mercury Playback Engine that allows much faster and smoother playback of video without rendering, it has two modes, software only and [GPU acceleration mode](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32876/gpu-accelerated-computing) (Using either CUDA or OpenCL). The GPU acceleration mode offers significant performance increases and is therefore highly desirable. However, not all GPU's are compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine, the list of those that are is found on the previously linked specification page, so if a new computer is being built or purchased, or upgrades are being considered prior to install, it is highly desirable to utilize a compatible GPU where possible.

#### 5\. Settings

Having covered the basic specifications of a computer that will enhance the operation of Premiere, it is now time to look at the computer settings and how this can affect Premiere's performance and usability.

The first thing to understand is that video editing, especially HD video, is bandwidth intensive, in effect, it fills up the lanes between the CPU, RAM, GPU and Hard Drive during operation. Spreading the use of that bandwidth over several devices can see huge performance gains, so one of the best ways to optimize the computer for Premier is to adjust how the hard drives are used. How effective this can be depends on the computer you are using, so we will try to cover a few different possibilities here.

#### 6\. Drive

If your computer contains a single drive, simply install Premiere and start using it, there are no options available here. If there are two drives, keep one for the operating system, programs and cache files. Use the second drive exclusively for video project files, exported projects and previews.

If the computer has three drives then keep one for the operating system and programs, the second one for the video project files, and use the third for previews, cache files and exported projects.

If you have access to even more drives, then split the cache from the previews, and ultimately have one drive each for previews, exports and cache. Spreading the files across as many drives as possible enhances performance by enabling the different read/write operations to occur without interference from each other.

That is the theory, but how do you achieve this? This is done within Premiere itself, there are two parts, accessing where the media cache files are placed is done though the edit menu, following the path edit > preferences > media.

![adobe premiere requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-1.png "adobe premiere requirements")

Changing where the project files, previews and exports are stored is just as easy, and is accessed via the project menu by taking the path project > project settings > scratchdisks.

![adobe premiere requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-2.png "adobe premiere requirements")

#### 7\. Sequence Setting

When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.

After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.

The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks

The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.

![adobe premiere requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-3.png "adobe premiere requirements")

Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.

Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.

While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.

Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.

## Conclusion

If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isnâ€™t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.

## How to Set Up Computer for Premiere

Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.

The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks

The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.

![adobe premiere requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-3.png "adobe premiere requirements")

Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.

Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.

While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.

Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.

## Conclusion

If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isnâ€™t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.

The only limiting factor are the output file formats because the app only allows you to save shrunk videos as **MPEG-4 and QuickTime files**.

 All the compressed videos can be easily shared on social media or sent through email and messaging apps directly from Video Compress.

#### How to shrink video size with this app?

Identifying large video files on your camera roll wonâ€™t take too much time since the app **displays the size of all videos**. Besides compressing videos, the Video Compressor app also lets you shrink photos you store on your iPhone or iPad.

Select a video you want to compress, by simply tapping on it, and then **choose a preset resolution** to which that video clip is going to be compressed. Optionally, you can **change the Bitrate** before tapping on the Compression button.

After the video compression process is over you can organize the shrunk videos effortlessly, however, you **must purchase the Pro version** of the app if you want to have access to all of the tools Video Compressor has to offer.

## Is there any iPhone free video compressor with editor built in?

Editing a video before you share it on social media can help you get rid of unwanted parts and make the colors more vivid. **iMovie** is an excellent choice if you would like to **trim a video or add filters and effects to it and reduce the video size**. Whatâ€™s more, you can use this iOS-native video editing app to reduce the size of the original video files.

Once you complete all video editing tasks you should exit the appâ€™s **Edit window** by tapping done and then tap on the **Share/Save Video** option. iMovie offers a variety of output video file formats, so you can choose if you want to save your video in **360p, 540p, HD or 4K resolution**. After you pick a preferred output resolution the iMovie is going to add the video to the Photo Library.

## Bonus: How to reduce video size on iPhone & iPad when recording?

All recent iPhone and iPad models support recording in a broad spectrum of video resolutions. If you would like to **decrease the resolution** at which your device captures videos you should head to the **Settings menu** and tap on the Camera option.

Select **Record Video** from the Camera menu and then choose the new resolution for your videos. The default resolution is set at 1080p at 30fps, but you can easily reduce it to 720p at 30fps if you want to create videos that donâ€™t take too much storage space.

The **Record Slo-Mo option** lets you choose between 720p HD at 120fps or 720p HD at 240 fps which allows you to preserve storage space while recording high-quality slow-motion videos.

**Conclusion**

Videos recorded with iPhones and iPads can be huge in size, and sending them or uploading them to the Internet can be a time-consuming process.
