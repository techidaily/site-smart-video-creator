## Part 2: Bonus: Best 5 Premiere Pro Intro Templates Free Download

Even though all websites we featured in this article offer some free intro templates for Adobe Premiere Pro. However, it is still a much better solution to buy a subscription plan on a platform if you are working on a large number of projects each month.

Let's see which websites you can use to download the intro and title templates for Premiere Pro.

### 16. [Motion Array](https://motionarray.com/browse)

In addition to an impressive library of intro templates, Motion Array offers presets, sound effects, royalty-free music, and stock footage.

Furthermore, you can choose the software version to make sure that the templates you download can be used with the version of Adobe Premiere Pro you have installed on your computer.

The website provides you with powerful search tools, so you can select the resolution of the template, up to 8K, or choose which types of templates are going to be displayed.

Using the free subscription plan can limit your options since you'll only be able to download free templates, and your upload storage will be limited to just 1GB.

The Pro subscription plan that can be purchased for $54 per month will grant you access to an almost endless selection of title templates as well as a huge selection of plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Motion-Array.jpg)

### 17. [Cinecom â€“ Simple Intro for Premiere Pro](https://www.cinecom.net/designer-packs/simple-titles-for-premiere-pro/)

It is a designer pack that features ten pre-animated lower-thirds intro templates. You can change the duration of the font and color of the text in each template, and you can choose if you want to download a 1080 or the 4K version of the designer pack.

The templates are compatible with CS6, CC2013, CC2014, and CC2016 versions of the Premiere Pro. The Simple Titles pack can be easily installed, as you just have to drag and drop it into the software.

However, before you can download these title templates, you have to subscribe to Cinecom's mailing list.

Even though this can be a bit inconvenient, it is very well worth the trouble since you'll be able to transform or build upon the intro templates and use them freely in all videos you edit in Adobe Premiere Pro.

### 18. [EnvatoElements](https://elements.envato.com/)

You can find much more than intro templates on the EnvatoElements platform since you can choose from 740.000 items you can use for anything from creating a WordPress website to preparing your next business presentation.

The Video Templates category alone features over 4000 items, including Logo Stings or Infographics assets.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 19. [Videohive](https://videohive.net/category/premiere-pro-templates/titles)

Videohive is a part of the Envato Market platform that also features Web Themes and Templates, Code, Audio, or Graphic sections. It is free to use, but only a limited amount of assets can be downloaded for free.

To download an item, you must purchase it, and prices can range from $16 to $50 for a single title template.

Videohive is also a great source of title templates for Adobe After Effects, as it offers more than 5000 titles and intros that are compatible with this software.

Furthermore, you can download presets for both Premiere Pro and After Effects that can be used to create stop-motion animations, perform color correction, or make the footage look like it was captured with a VHS camera.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Videohive.jpg)

### 20. [RocketStock](https://www.rocketstock.com/free-after-effects-templates/free-cinematic-title-library-for-premiere-pro/)

This option is best suited for video editors who want to create their intros because RocketStok's Cinematic Style Library extends the scope of options provided by Premiere Pro.

Downloading all fonts except Helvetica Neue is free, but you must check which fonts you can use in commercial projects. You will have no trouble installing the fonts since you can just double-click on the font and follow the on-screen instructions.

Once you've installed all the fonts from the library, you can use them to replace the software's default library. You just have to click on the Replace Style Library option that can be accessed from Premiere Pro's Title Style tab.

If you don't feel comfortable creating your titles or if you simply don't have the time to create your own titles, the Free Cinematic Style Library is not the best choice for you.

On the other hand, Premiere Pro's users who don't often use title templates can benefit from downloading RocketStock's intro library.

If you download the template, all the title templates support customization. You can change its size, font, color, and add 3D effects.

It is easy to import and use it to touch up your video. Check out the steps below to know how to import title templates quickly.

1. **Install the title template**. Choose one template you like and download it to your PC. Remember to unzip it before importing it. Now install them.
2. **Import the title template**. You just need to go to click **Effects** at the top. Then at right, you will find Presets in the effects section.
3. Right-click on presets, and choose **Import Presets**. If the title template format is .mogrt, you need to open it in Essential Graphics Panel. At the bottom right corner, click the plus icon to import the title template and install it.
4. **Customize the title template**. Once the title template is imported, drag it to the timeline. Click the Editing tab. Here you can customize colors, text, opacities, and positions. There are more options for you to explore.
5. You can also copy and paste the title template to another place in the timeline. If you change one place of the pasted template, the original one will remain the same.

**Note**: each version of Premiere's interface will look different, but the workflow is similar.

### Conclusion

Using title templates can help you achieve a certain visual style faster, so you don't have to spend a lot of time looking for a perfect background or animating the text.

The Internet provides almost unlimited video editing resources, but not all of these resources can be acquired for free.

Which website you will choose as a source of fresh title templates depends on how often you work on new projects in Adobe Premiere Pro.
