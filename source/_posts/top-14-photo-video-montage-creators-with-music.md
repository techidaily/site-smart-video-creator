Vegas Pro is the popular video editing program in Windows. It provides decent video editing features including audio editing, video editing, transition, and titles, and more. But wait a minute, Sony Vegas Pro has not the feature you want? Can't import your video source files? Any other problems? Drop it and find a **?Vegas alternative for Windows** in this article.

In this article, we selected the **top 4 alternatives of Vegas for Windows.**

---

## Vegas alternative for Windows

#### 1\. Adobe Premiere Elements - A Program like Sony Vegas

When a product is branded with Adobe, it means high quality, better performance, and consistency with another program by Adobe. [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html) is a **good Vegas alternative for Windows** (Mac version also available). Just as what's said on its homepage "the #1 consumer video editing software", Adobe is a popular video editor for home users.

![sony vegas alternative adobe premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-elements-2021-interface.png)

For professionals, Adobe Premiere Pro is the better Sony Vegas alternative for Windows. It's the higher version of Premiere Element with differences in capturing, timeline editing, multiple sequence editing, DVD menu, surround sound mixing, etc.

#### 2\. ZS4 Video Editor - Free Alternative to Sony Vegas in Windows

[ZS4 Video Editor](http://www.zs4.net/news) is a free Sony Vegas alternative for Windows, Mac and Linux. It is the new incarnation of the free Zwei-Stein Video Editor. It comes with simple video editing tools and 150 video effects, but the interface is not so user-friendly. Compared to Wondershare [Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Adobe Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html), ZS4 Video Editor is not the common video editing software, but free is the most important factor for this Sony Vegas alternative.

![sony vegas alternative for windows](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/zs4-video-editor-windows.jpg)

#### 3. Filmora - Get things done easily, no more fussing

**What We Don't Like:**

**●** In order to access the exclusive features of the tool, you'd need to buy the premium version

**●** You can only perform one conversion at a time

**●** You'd encounter several annoying advertisements while using the online application

**A YouTube tutorial about the audio conversion tool:**

### 06Zamzar

Zamzar Is one of the most popular online converting tools. It does not just have audio conversion features but also image conversion, video conversion and other files conversion. The tool is perfect for individuals who wish to convert their audio files just for a project. However, professionals who need to convert audio files often are not advised to use this platform. The user interface is pretty appealing and colourful and the zamzar convertor allows multiple conversions

**What We Like:**

**●** The tool is a one stop shop that allows you to convert multiple files

**●** The tool allows you to directly share the converted audio via mail. Hence, you needn't download the audio files

**●** The tool also has an online version if you wish to use it online

**What We Don't Like:**

**●** The tool limits it's free usage only to a 50 mb. Upon reaching the limit, you'd need to buy the paid version

**●** The download process is slightly tedious

**●** It does not have any editing options
