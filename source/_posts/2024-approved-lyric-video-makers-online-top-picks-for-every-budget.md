## How to Make a Time-Lapse Video in Final Cut Pro

#### Step 1 Import Clips

Choose **File** \> **New** \> **Event**. Name it and click **OK**. Label the project **Timelapse**. Then go to **File** \> **Import Media**. Browse to source clips folder. Click **Import Selected**. Drop the clips onto the timeline.

#### Step 2 Apply Time-lapse Effect

Click the **Retime** pop-up menu below the viewer and choose **Fast** (or you can access **Modify** \> **Retime** \> **Fast**). There are 4 preset options you can choose: 2x, 4x, 8x, 20x. Or you can customize the speed by selecting **Custom**.

![ Apply Timelapse effect -1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/timelapse-in-fcp-1.png)

You can set any speed by adjusting the **Rate**. Reset the speed by clicking on the little arrow on the right side of the window.

![ Apply Timelapse effect -2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/timelapse-in-fcp-3.png)

You can also drag the retiming handle to adjust the speed: dragging to the left increases the speed, and dragging to the right decreases it.

**Note:** To set speed separately for different parts of one clip, you can choose **Blade Speed** first, and then blade the clip where you want to set different speeds.
