### 4  Cyberlink PowerDirector 365

**Supported System**: Windows, MacOS

**Pricing:** Free trial for 30 days

The video editing program PowerDirector from CyberLink bridges the gap between professional editing and user-friendliness. It has frequently been ahead of the curve in terms of support for new formats and techniques.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the song and select **Add to Music Track** or drag the music onto the playlist.

**Pricing:** Free trial

Movavi is a video editing program with a straightforward, user-friendly interface. PiP, chroma-key, titling, adding music to video, basic keyframing, and motion tracking are all included. It isn't as feature-rich or speedy as some competitors, but it allows you to create appealing work quickly.

**Step 2:** Every file you choose will be instantly placed on the Movavi timeline, with video files will appear on the Video Track and audio files on the **Audio Track**. To eliminate the unnecessary section of the audio file, click the **Split** option.

**Step 3**: Simply press **Start** and wait for your movie to be exported after selecting the correct video format and setting the destination folder by deciding on the **Save to** section.

**Conclusion**

Any video without some background soundtrack or any music, in general, appears to be at its 50% percent. Users tend to lose interest soon if they don't have something playing in the background all the time.
