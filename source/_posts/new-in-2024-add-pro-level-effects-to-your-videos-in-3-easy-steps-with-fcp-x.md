There are two broad categories of effects in Final Cut Pro X: Inspector effects and Effects Browser effects.

I've written previously about how to use Inspector effects to create a [picture-in-picture](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effect, among many other effects available to us in Final Cut Pro. In this article, I want to show you how to apply an effect to a clip, modify that effect, temporarily turn that effect on or off, or delete it entirely.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Apply Effects to Video in Final Cut Pro X

* [Find and apply an effect](#part1)
* [Modify an effect](#part2)
* [Disable and delete an effect](#part3)
* [Extra credit](#part4)

#### Find and apply an effect

Here is our clip - a fearsome polar bear.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx001.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To apply an effect, first select the clip in the Timeline.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx002.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Then, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Effects Browser (or type Cmd + 5).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx003.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The Browser, like all the effects browsers, lists categories of effects on the left, a search box at the bottom to use for searching for the names of effects, and effects for each category on the right.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx004.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Here, for example, I've selected the Blur category, with my cursor near the Gaussian blur effect. (Gaussian blur is the best effect to use when you want a clip to look blurry.)

To apply an effect, do one of two things:

* Drag the effect from the Browser onto the clip you want to change.
* If the clip, or clips, are selected, double-click the effect in the Browser to apply it.

#### Modify an effect

To modify an effect, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Inspector (or type Cmd + 4).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx005.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Click the Video tab in the Inspector. Effects from the Effects Browser are always listed at the top of the Inspector.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx006.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Grab a slider and drag it to see what happens. For example, to make an image blurrier, drag the Amount slider to the right. To lessen the effect, drag it to the left.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx007.jpg "add effects in fcp")

#### Disable and delete an effect

To temporarily disable an effect, without deleting it, click the blue box so that it turns gray.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx008.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To enable an effect, click the gray box so it turns blue again.

To delete an effect, click the name of the effect - in this example: Gaussian - and press the big Delete key.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx009.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The effect will be deleted from the selected clip.

#### Extra credit

You can apply, modify, even delete the same effect to multiple clips by first selecting all the clips you want to change in the Timeline then adding, changing the settings, or deleting an effect in the Inspector.

#### Summary

The process of applying effects is the same for all effects you apply from the Effects Browser. In future articles I'll show you how to use this technique to create a wide variety of different effects in Final Cut Pro X.

## User-Friendly Video Editing Apps

New to video editing and don't know how and where to edit videos, don't have a media production, or can't find a qualified video editor to film and produce your highlights? It's all fine! The purpose of today's article is to demonstrate that, with the correct video editor, you also can create slick, sophisticated video content—regardless of perception—and maintain your content marketing strategy ahead of the game.

In the coming year, [over half of marketers](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-content-videos) will add YouTube and Facebook platforms for streaming video; one-third of all internet usage is spent viewing video; video will make for more than 80% of all internet traffic by 2019\. 80% of the time! Let's get started! From the most affordable (i.e., free!) for the beginners. Here is the best **basic video editor** that includes the features you'll find handy in a video editor.

#### In this article

01 [ Best Basic Video Editors for Windows and Mac \[Free and Paid\] ](#part1)

02 [Best Free Basic Video Editors Online](#part2)

## Part 1: Best Basic Video Editors for Windows and Mac \[Free and Paid\]

What should you do when you do not have access to a video studio or a team of video experts on staff to film and edit your videos? Do not be concerned!

Without the need for an in-house team or outsourcing your video brand awareness, it's quicker than ever to make high-quality films on your own. Here are some of the top picks.

### 1\. Windows Photos App

Microsoft Photos, a free digital viewer and video editor included with Windows 10 and Windows 11, provides capable visual effects and video enhancements, as well as techniques for organizing and editing videos, everything in a touch-friendly functionality. Windows 10/11 comes with the Photos app pre-integrated. You don't have to do anything to obtain the app when you have Windows 10/11.

The free Microsoft photo and video editing app is a great choice for viewing, editing, and sharing digital photos and videos. As the name suggests, it's for Windows users – a delight to use a picture and video-editing tool that's simple to use, clean, and has all the functions you need for basic viewing and repairs. Obviously, a full-featured program like the Windows Photos App is required for advanced photo organizing, optimization, and effects.

![windows photos app interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-photos-app-interface.jpg)

Clips may be trimmed or divided, [text can be added](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), motion or 3D effects can be applied, filters can be used, and the [speed can be changed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It's a huge array that allows you to create an interesting result. There are over 20 options for [adding soundtracks](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at the backend at the top.

The Photos app features the Automatic Video tool which can [create video automatically with the images or videos uploaded](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

Okay, so this one won't actually apply to those of you who deal with computers, but we'd be negligent if we left it off the roster. Thanks to its high-class interface, it doesn't get much nicer than Apple iMovie regarding elegance and beauty. It is only supported by macOS and iOS.

The ten [high-fidelity filters in iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are among the best in the video editing game, and you can utilize AirDrop to instantly and smoothly transmit your video to your Mac when you're filming on your iPhone or working on your iPad.

![imovie editing interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-editing-interface.jpg)

[Green-screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), or "chroma-key," is among iMovie's most prized tools since it enables you to relocate your characters to exotic locations—say, Hawaii—at any time. Do you want to add "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" to the image? Because iMovie is integrated with iTunes and GarageBand, you may quickly add unique music and sounds to your movie. Once your video is finished, send it out into the world via iMessage, Facebook, YouTube, or any of iMovie's numerous easily accessible venues.

Here are some tips and tricks in editing videos with iMovie, hope that will help you edit faster.

### 3\. [Apple Photos App](https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/)

Apple Photos, a free app included with macOS and iOS, is our pick for the best basic video editing software for Mac and iOS users because it embodies the company's concept of fun, easy-to-use software. The interface of Apple Photos is clean, straightforward, and direct, allowing you to express yourself using basic, uncomplicated shortcuts rather than the complex layers of capabilities seen in more feature-rich products. It is only supported by Apple devices only.

Years, collections, and Moments are used to arrange the videos. Only current devices with 64-bit CPUs, such as the iPhone 5s or above, is compliant with the new release of Apple Photos. The Apple Photos mobile application includes thumbnail sliders to switch numerous characteristics of a photo quickly, in addition to options for auto-enhance, red-eye removal, and crop/rotate.

In Adjust, for example, you may move an indicator over a thumbnail variant to change the video's luminance or color intensity. The one-click filters are basic, but they can provide some interesting results. You can also use your fingers or type text on display to mark up a video, trim a video and save it as a short teaser, change the slow-motion segment of a film, and trim a video and save it as a new video.

Here are some of the [best Apple video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), make sure to check it if you’re using a Mac.

### 4\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

In terms of video editors, Wondershare Filmora has long been a current favorite of several, particularly regular customers, due to its ease of use. You will be met with the interface where you will do all of your film editing production. You'll note how clean, tidy, and uncomplicated it looks and seems at first sight.

For macOS 10.12 or later

Library, Timeline, and Preview are the three options available in the interface. By heading to a specific section of the video on your timeline, double-clicking the area, waiting for it to pop into the preview segment, and then adding effects, transitions, audio, or stabilizing and correcting the video using any of the editing options that are available to you, you can perform simple video editing features.

![filmora video editor main interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-video-editor-main-interface.jpg)

Additional but equally impressive functions include Lens Correction, Compositing, which applies blend modes to transitions and overlays; Drop Shadow, which applies shadows to images and words. And Auto Enhance, which significantly improves the quality of a substandard video.

### 5\. Adobe Premiere Elements

[Adobe Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html) allows even beginner editors to create polished projects from their video sources. It's an all-in-one video editing and video production software for those who love graphic user interfaces and straightforward layouts. You may sketch around an item or region within a video after adding an effect to it.

As the videos go on, Elements keeps track of this item and conceals the effect on it. You can brighten the sky, change the color of a driving car, and blur a person's face. Guided Edits, which walk the user step-by-step through multiple things, is a fundamental component of Elements. It is supported by Windows

They help learn the ropes and gain confidence thanks to the user-friendly design. The current version of Premiere Elements has received some under-the-hood improvements, depending less on the CPU and more on the graphics card to improve results.

## Part 5: Extensive Reading: What are Sound Effects and Why are they Important?

Sound is the most important aspect of video editing that engages audiences, evokes emotional responses, and connects people to what they’re seeing. A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.

Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.

Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.

Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.

Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.

That's why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like **Filmora**. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora![](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

Sound effects are external audio files added to the videos to make them look interesting and worth watching. A perfect balance of sound, music, and silence allows the filmmakers to define the tone of their narrative and deliver their message creatively.

You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources. To add sound effects to your video, use professional video-editing software like Final Cut Pro or Filmora. Both these applications are user-friendly and possess a huge library of a variety of sound effects and music files. Besides, their advanced features allow you to naturally add sound effects without affecting the video quality.

These sounds fill the screen space to create a virtual sense of an environment or location such as the clattering sound of dishes in a restaurant or the sound of engines on a highway.

1. **Foley SFX**

A mixture of live performance and digital sound editing, these sounds are produced by the artists of Foley studio to match their sounds to the on-screen visuals.

1. **Hard and Soft SFX**

Hard SFX synchronizes a visual to what’s happening in the picture while SFX indicates the location to the audience.

1. **Electronic SFX**

These sounds are generated by instruments that create electronic-sounding effects like electronic keyboards, synthesizers, or plug-ins.

## Part 5: Extensive Reading: What are Sound Effects and Why are they Important?

Sound is the most important aspect of video editing that engages audiences, evokes emotional responses, and connects people to what they’re seeing. A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.

Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.

Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.

Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.

Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.

That's why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like **Filmora**. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora![](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

Sound effects are external audio files added to the videos to make them look interesting and worth watching. A perfect balance of sound, music, and silence allows the filmmakers to define the tone of their narrative and deliver their message creatively.

You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources. To add sound effects to your video, use professional video-editing software like Final Cut Pro or Filmora. Both these applications are user-friendly and possess a huge library of a variety of sound effects and music files. Besides, their advanced features allow you to naturally add sound effects without affecting the video quality.

 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.

## Best Websites for Downloading Public Domain Images

 We’ve searched the Internet and we utilized our results to compile a collection of the most reliable websites that grant its users access to vast numbers of public domain images. Let’s take a look at some of the best websites that let you download public domain images.

Clicking on the Popular Searches tab will enable you to see the images from Light, Nature or Animals and it will shorten the amount of time you have to spend looking for a photo you want to download.

 With a library that contains over 800,000 photos, Unsplash is easily one of the largest websites that offer public domain images.

Alternatively, you can insert a keyword into a search bar and Unsplash will show you the results within seconds.

 Morguefile is a website that offers stock footage to its users, but some of the images can’t be downloaded for free. That’s why you must click on the Free Photos tab before you start searching for public domain images on this website. The website hosts nearly 400.000 photos, videos, and vector graphics, but you must make sure that a file you want to download is within the public domain before you download it. The only downside is that the images aren’t organized into categories which can make finding the images you’re searching for more difficult than it needs to be.

**Pros:**

* Creating an account on Morguefile is free
* All free photos can be used on commercial projects

**Cons:**

* Images can be organized better
* Fewer free images than on other public domain image websites

## How to Cite Public Domain Images Properly?

* The title of the image
* Author’s name
* Information about the institution at which an image is kept
* The source from which you acquired an image

 In case you don’t have access to all of these information or if the information is simply not available you should include all details about a public domain image you have the access to.

 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

However, these categories don’t contain more than a few hundred photos and some of them offer as few as five pictures you can download. All photos are in high resolution and ready for professional use. The download process can be completed effortlessly in just a few quick steps. New images are added on a weekly basis.

**Pros:**

* Professional quality of images
* All images are free

**Cons:**

* A limited selection of photos
* Doesn’t offer vector graphics

#### 10. [Viintage](https://www.viintage.com/)

 Viintage is a gold mine for graphic designers as it grants them access to hundreds of vintage posters, book covers, and images. However, the amount of public domain images this website offers is limited and if you want to download the images from the collections of works created by famous artists from the late 19th and early 20th centuries you must purchase the premium version of Viintage. The website lacks some basic search options as it only allows you to type in the search term into the search bar. The images are not organized into categories which further complicates the process of finding a public domain image you’re looking for.

**Pros:**

* Offers a collection of rare vintage public domain images
* A great resource for graphic designers

**Cons:**

* Most images on Viintage can’t be downloaded for free
* Search tools are far from perfect

## How to Cite Public Domain Images Properly?

 If you’re planning on using a public domain image in a blog or on your website, you must cite the source from which you acquired a particular image. The image citations should include the following information:

* The title of the image
* Author’s name
* Information about the institution at which an image is kept
* The source from which you acquired an image

 In case you don’t have access to all of these information or if the information is simply not available you should include all details about a public domain image you have the access to. Furthermore, there are several styles of image citations that depend on the source from which an image was acquired.

**Conclusion**

 Spending large sums of money on images you can use in commercial or private projects is not always necessary. The public domain images are widely available and they can be used in a broad range of contexts. Which website that lets you download public domain images do you like to use the most?
