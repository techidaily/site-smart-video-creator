 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to learning a new language.

This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024

## The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: [Ablo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en)

Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.

![ 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ablo-chat-app-best-app-google-play.jpg)

Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.

The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.

## The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play

Smartphones bring entertainment to the palms of our hands and grant us instant access to information that makes our lives easier. Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.

If you opt for one of the available subscription models you will have an unlimited amount of learning time at your disposal.

Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors.

Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.

It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to learning a new language.

This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users.

## The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: [Ablo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en)

Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.

![

Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.

The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.

Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors.

Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.

 Reaching the widest audience possible is the goal of every video content creator, but achieving this goal might be impossible if the videos you share online are not saved in the right file format. [MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is probably the most common video file there is, because it is compatible with a broad range of [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as well as [online video hosting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and social media platforms.

 WebM, on the other hand, is perfectly suited for videos that are viewed from Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, but only a handful of desktop-based media players offer support for this video file format.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files.
