There are multiple versions of this multiplatform video editor at different price points, in addition to a free version. How can you go wrong? This is one of the reasons why VideoPad is one of the best free video editing software programs.

VideoPad Video Editor is compatible with both Mac and Windows computers and supports a number of video import and export options. This nch video editor comes with a free basic plan where you don't have to pay anything, so you can try to see how it works. In this article, we will do a quick review of this video editing software so that you have a better understanding of its features.

## **Features of VideoPad**

The features list of videopad video editor is as follows:

* You can share videos with your family and friends
* Facebook and YouTube videos can be uploaded directly
* Multiple resolutions for exporting movies
* Burn DVDs and Blu-rays
* You can save the file to your PSP, iPod, iPhone, or 3GP mobile phone
* Visual effects and video transitions
* Effects models for visual effects
* Editing 3D videos
* 2D to 3D stereoscopic conversion
* 360 video overlays and texts
* Optimization of videos
* Reducing camera shake
* Sequences can be enhanced with photos and digital images
* Tools for audio production
* Mix music and import it
* A library of sound effects
* Any camera can be used to create videos

### **Ease of use and interface**

With VideoPad's easy-to-use interface and well-organized conventions, movie makers of any skill level can become familiar with its basics in no time at all. You will become fluent in no time at all in opening and closing windows, stringing clips together, and adding narration, transitions, and text to create a powerful visual presentation. Adding video, audio, and still, photo assets to the files pane will put them on the timeline and allow you to assemble your story.

Videos and still images are organized into bins by the app, ensuring they don't get confused on the timeline, which speeds up the workflow, especially for newcomers.

The app uses menus and can be dragged and dropped, so a single objective can be accomplished in different ways. You can control all functions from within the application frame, or dockable panels can be used to get a closer look at what needs to be done. A permanent reorganization of the workspace would be appreciated.

### **Videopad Video Editing Features**

VideoPad is the perfect balance between too much and not enough. Although there are not many options, it offers a reasonable selection of transitions for moving between clips and images, as well as a selection of filters to give them a unique look. In addition to editing 360-degree video, video stabilization is another helpful feature.

Each filter can be previewed with a click before applying it, and You can combine several to create a custom effect or template for reuse. You can also adjust their length via menus.

A video can be enhanced with transitions, visual effects, overlays, and text using VideoPad. Also included are some basic audio tools and a library of sound effects and atmospheric background music. There are a number of features that allow you to optimize videos, including color correction, adding digital images, adding subtitles, and adjusting the speed of playback. With its video stabilization feature, you can reduce camera shake, and the high-end version supports special effect plugins, but only for Windows.

### **Videopad Audio Editing Features**

VideoPad offers a limited set of audio tools, but it does allow you to mix multiple audio tracks, music, and narration to create a movie soundtrack. A video clip's audio can be faded, mixed, and adjusted for volume, but if you want to go further, you'll need an external mixer or editor. From VideoPad's main menu, you can download NCH's own WavePad.

While the text-to-speech features always sounded false, you can record narration directly within the program. There is a great idea in having voice recognition for subtitles, which is only available on the Windows version. However, the implementation falls short of expectations. Although the video was clearly spoken in a quiet environment, it automatically failed to translate into subtitles.

### **Videopad Content Sharing features**

Video creators who publish to YouTube or other social media platforms can use the software because it allows them to share videos directly to platforms such as Dropbox, Flickr, Google Drive, and Vimeo. To avoid unnecessary data sharing, you can save videos to your desktop and upload them yourself.

### **Is VideoPad worth buying?**

Although the VideoPad video editor free version is somewhat limited, it functions as a free trial to see if you like it enough to upgrade. Apps that are easy to use and have a simple interface can help convert a free user to a paying customer, and VideoPad has a strong claim to your money thanks to its simplicity and light hardware requirements.

## **Our Recommendation**

As a beginner, you may be looking to use Videopad free, but when it comes to features, it just falls short compared to modern video editors. So, we recommend you use our Filmora X video editor. Filmora video editor is free to download, so you can try out all the features without paying a penny. However free version will have a watermark when you export the video. You will have to purchase a subscription to get rid of the watermark. If you compare the features and user-friendliness of both these video editors, then Filmora definitely stands out by all means. In addition to its feature richness, it also has a user-friendly interface that beginners can easily adapt to. So, don't waste your time and give it a try right now.

## Part 1: How to Fade Audio by using the Modify Menu

![ Select the audio or the video clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fade-audio-in-fcp-1.png)

![Apply fades](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fade-audio-in-fcp-2.png)

You should remember that the fades appear at the beginning and the end of each clip. The default duration of the fade is one half-second. If you want to modify that duration, you just have to drag the fade handle up to the point where your fade is supposed to begin or end.

## Part 2: How to Fade Music by using Fade Handles

You have already learned how to find the fade handles on the screen. Now, you just have to manually drag the handle to the exact point from which you want the fade to begin or end. Just keep in mid this simple rule: fade handles at the beginning of a clip produce fade-in effects, whereas fade handles at the end give fade-out effects.

You can manually fade-in or out a portion of the audio clip on your timeline by using the fade handles. Place the pointer over the clip and you can see the fade handles appearing in the top left and right corners of the waveform. To change the sound of the fade, you'll have to modify the shape of the fade by selecting one of the several preconfigured choices.

**Using the fade handles to create crossfades:**

**Step 1** **:** To create a crossfade, first you have to select two adjacent clips in the timeline. After that choose Clip> Expand Audio (or press Control-S). You can see the waveforms on your screen expanding.

**Step 2** **:** To overlap the audio parts of the two clips on your timeline, just drag the end point of the first clip and the start point of the second clip.

**Step 3** **:** Now, you'll have to drag the fade handles of each clip to the exact points where you want the fade to start and finish.

* Linear: Maintains a constant rate of change over the length of the fade.
* S-curve: Eases in and out of the fade with the midpoint at 0 dB.
* +3dB: Starts quickly and then slowly tapers off toward the end. This is the most useful setting for quick fades.
* –3dB: Starts slowly and then moves quickly toward the end. This is the default setting and is best for maintaining a natural volume when crossfading between two adjacent clips.
