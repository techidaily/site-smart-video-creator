As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete.

The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD[video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the **best free DVD players** on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.

## Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10

Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and [video file formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.
