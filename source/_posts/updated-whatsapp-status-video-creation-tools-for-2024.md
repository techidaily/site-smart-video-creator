A box will pop up at the bottom of the screen; this is referred to as the Timeline, and it's where the different pieces you're adding to the video will appear, including images layers, text layers, and video clips.

![how to trim video using kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-3.png)

### Step 5

Your video plays from the left side to the right side. The Play icon allows you to play the video and preview your project. Use the seeker to go to any point of your video that you want to see how it will look like.

![trim video using kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-4.png)

![a guide to trim video using kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-5.png)

### Step 7

To trim the video, click the Trim button.

![trim video with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-6.png)

Click and drag the ends of your video to adjust the end and start times of the video layer. Anything that you remove won't be in the final video.

![steps to trim video with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-7.png)

If you have more layers on your project, click and select the layer you would like to trim.

### Step 8

You can also use the Timing tab to trim your video. To do this, click your clip and head over to the top right side of your screen.

![use timing to trim video with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-8.png)

You can now specify the exact time you would like the video to start and end instead of using the clicking and dragging method.

![use timing to trim video with kapwing - set time range](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-9.png)

Clicking the numerals will allow you to use the up and down arrow keys and trim the video to start and end where you have specified.

You can also use the seeker to set the time where you would like the video to start and end, and then go to the numerals and click set to the current time.

Kapwing Video Trimmer will create a huge gap when you select this option. You'll see a blank white canvas until the video starts.

You can leave this white space and add other clips or remove it so that your video starts at zero by clicking it and hitting the Delete key on your keyboard.

### Step 9

Once you have finished trimming your video with Video Trimmer Kapwing, click the Export Video button.

![export trim vieo in kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-10.png)

You'll have to sign in to remove the watermark. Click the Download button to download the trimmed video to your device.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

[Microsoft Photos](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-photos/9WZDNCRFJBH4?hl=en-pk&gl=PK) or Photo App is a free photo viewer and editor with your Windows 10\. It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

**Features**

* Quick video trimming
* Cool text effects
* 3D library and effects

### Handbrake

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-24.jpg)

[Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) is best-known for its video transcoding traits. Unlike typical video editors, this open-source tool includes limited options to rip Blu-rays and DVDs. Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free
* You can convert batch videos with ease
* It supports MAC, Windows, and Linux OS
* Allows you to import video files in all major formats
* The software comes with various video conversion presets

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free

**Features**

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free

**Features**

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free

**Features**
