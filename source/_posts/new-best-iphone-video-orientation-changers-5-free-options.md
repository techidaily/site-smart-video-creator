## 10 Online Rotators for Rotating Videos

# Best Online Video Rotators for Rotating Videos \[Win/Mac\]

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Until recently, horizontally oriented videos were one of the rare undisputed industry standards, but with the rapid advancement of phone cameras and social media networks that support vertically oriented videos, a growing number of people need to rotate their videos. It is important to note that if you choose to rotate a video, the results you are going to get maybe underwhelming, to say the least, because the video’s aspect ratio is going to remain the same. The process of rotating a video is rather simple, and you don’t need access to a professional video editing app like Adobe Premiere Pro to perform this task, because there are quite a few online platforms you can use to rotate your videos online.

## Rotate Video with Animation in Wondershare Filmora on Windows and Mac

Wondershare Filmora is a widely used video editor for YouTubers on the market. In the latest Filmora version, you can add animation to rotation, and make the video rotation animated.

## How to Rotate Videos Online For Free

The number of supported file formats, as well as the maximum size of a video file you can upload to the platforms that allow its users to rotate videos, can limit your options significantly. That’s why you need to make sure that each video you want to rotate online meets the platform’s specifications. Let’s take a look at some of the best online platforms you can use to rotate your videos online.

#### 2. Kapwing

Website: <https://www.kapwing.com/rotate>

![online video rotator - kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-video-online-in-kapwing.jpg)

Kapwing is an [online video editing platform](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that offers a wide spectrum of video editing tools that enable you to resize or add text to videos, among other things. You can either **upload a video** to Kapwing from your computer or you can **use the video’s URL to import it to Kapwing** if it is stored online.

Once you’ve uploaded the file you simply have to choose if you want to **rotate a video for 90, 180, or 270 degrees** and click on the Export Video button. Kapwing provides the rotation presets of 90, 180, 270, and 360 degrees, which allows you to rotate the video quickly. When you click the Rotate button, you will see the degree number beside. What about rotating at any angle? That’s simple in Kapwing, you can drag the Rotate button to any degree based on your need. Please note if you’re using the Kapwing free plan, the largest video that you can upload is 250MB.

Make sure that the checkbox next to the option you’ve selected is checked, **choose the output format,** and then **click on the Rotate button**.

It is important to note that if you choose to rotate a video, the results you are going to get maybe underwhelming, to say the least, because the video’s aspect ratio is going to remain the same. The process of rotating a video is rather simple, and you don’t need access to a professional video editing app like Adobe Premiere Pro to perform this task, because there are quite a few online platforms you can use to rotate your videos online.
