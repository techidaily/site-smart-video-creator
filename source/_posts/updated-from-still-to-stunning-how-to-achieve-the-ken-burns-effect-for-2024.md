**Step 2: Check Your Settings**

As you can see, our timeline has no other video clip. Hence, Final Cut Pro will not recognize the clip until you adjust the video properties such as format, resolution, and rate, etc. For this purpose, click OK to use your preferred settings and press Shift + Z to fit the picture to your timeline window. Once you’re done it’s time to apply the Ken Burns Effect.

**Step 3: Add the Ken Burns Effect**

The Ken Burns Effect is used to focus on specific parts of an image and bring motionless content in to provoke emotional reactions. Follow these steps to add the Ken Burns Effect:

1. Select the clip or picture;
2. See the lower left of the viewer;
3. Go to the Viewer window using the drop-down menu;
4. Tap on the pop-up menu located in the bottom left-hand corner;
5. Choose the Crop option from the menu or press Shift + C;

**Step 4: Customize Your Effect**

In the Ken Burns display, you can see the controls for adjusting the panning and zooms effects by changing the size and position of two-colored rectangles overlaying on the clip. To customize the Ken Burns effect:

1. Adjust the green rectangle’s size and position to set the start position;
2. Adjust the red rectangle’s size and position to set the end position;
3. The arrow depicts the direction of camera position between start and end position;
4. In the top left-hand corner, click on the Swap button to exchange the two positions as per your requirements;
5. You can see the preview of the animation on the screen.

**Step 5: Add a Freeze Frame**

You’re not done yet because you need to hold your picture at the end of the animation. For this purpose, you should create a freezing frame at the end of the clip to make Ken Burns do this. Here’s the deal:

1. Press the Down arrow followed by the Left arrow to go to the last frame;
2. Press Option-F to add a freeze-frame;
3. Make sure that your added frame matches the ending frame of the Ken Burns Effect.

**Step 6: Adjust the Duration of the Freeze Frame**

The users can also adjust the speed of the animation and the duration of the freeze-frame by trimming your clip. For this purpose, trim the length as per your requirement and it will optimize the speed as shown in figure 6.

**Step 7: Swap the Start and End Frame**

Now, swap the start and ending frame as per your preference for the Ken Burns animation. Here’s how you can do this:

1. Click on the Swap button;
2. The start frame will match the still frame (previous one);
3. Grab the end frame and move it to your desired position;

## Part 2: How to add the Ken Burns Effect to Multiple Camera Movements?

Although you can apply a single Ken Burns movement to your image, you can still give the impression of multiple movements being used. This means the Ken Burns Effect can be added to multiple camera movements by duplicating the photo and building numerous movements in sequence.

1. Add the first camera movement to your image;
2. Duplicate the clip by click and drag option or copy and paste option;
3. Press the Swap button in the Ken Burns settings to reverse the start and end positions;
4. Verify if multiple camera movements have been added.

## **Extensive Reading: Why Ken Burns Effect is Named after Ken Burns?**

**What is the Ken Burns Effect?**

The Ken Burns Effect is a feature in Final Cut Pro to create a pan and zoom effect by using your predefined start and end positions. Basically, it is a crop effect with one crop at the start of the clip while the other at the end. Ken Burns Effect can be further customized by adjusting the smoothness of the animation. While creating a Ken Burns Effect, the motion applied to the video clips gets automatically smoothed to accelerate and decelerate the movement slowly at the start and the end of the animation.

**Why the Effect is named after Ken Burns?**

Now, as you have learned the purpose of the Ken Burns Effect, you must be curious about its name. It is named after American documentarian Ken Burns, who is known for his instantly recognizable and highly influential visual aesthetic. Surprisingly, Ken Burns did not invent this Ken Burns Effect; rather, it has existed for decades. You might be wondering why the technique was then named after Ken Burns. This was due to the persistent and adroit use of this technique that it is now known as the Ken Burns Effect.

![ken-burns](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/ken-burns.png)

**What are the Applications of Ken Burns Effect?**

Primarily, the Ken Burns Effect is used due to the unavailability of a film or video. The technique gives action to still photographs to glorify the subjects of interest like couples in wedding photography. It gets better and better as you apply simulated parallax with Ken Burns Effect to make your 2D images appear as 3D plus advanced zooming visuals. You can also use the Ken Burns effect to make a video of your graduation ceremony pictures or memorable moments of reunion. Ken Burns Effect is also used in documentaries by professional filmmakers and editors.

**Conclusion**

Adding animated effects to your pictures and videos makes them look gorgeous. This is crazy, isn’t it, when you impress your peers with your editing skills. So, what’s the bottom line of this whole discussion? Try adding the Ken Burns Effect with Final Cut Pro to create a pan and zoom effect on your pictures and clips get the output in your desired format.

## **Extensive Reading: Why Ken Burns Effect is Named after Ken Burns?**

**What is the Ken Burns Effect?**

The Ken Burns Effect is a feature in Final Cut Pro to create a pan and zoom effect by using your predefined start and end positions. Basically, it is a crop effect with one crop at the start of the clip while the other at the end. Ken Burns Effect can be further customized by adjusting the smoothness of the animation. While creating a Ken Burns Effect, the motion applied to the video clips gets automatically smoothed to accelerate and decelerate the movement slowly at the start and the end of the animation.

**Why the Effect is named after Ken Burns?**

Now, as you have learned the purpose of the Ken Burns Effect, you must be curious about its name. It is named after American documentarian Ken Burns, who is known for his instantly recognizable and highly influential visual aesthetic. Surprisingly, Ken Burns did not invent this Ken Burns Effect; rather, it has existed for decades. You might be wondering why the technique was then named after Ken Burns. This was due to the persistent and adroit use of this technique that it is now known as the Ken Burns Effect.

# Best Websites for Turning a Photo into a Cartoon

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Cartooning a photo is a simple and yet effective way of enhancing a picture and making it more visually appealing. Besides adding an artistic touch to portraits you take, cartooning a photo can also be a great way to have fun with your friends because the results of picture cartooning can be as entertaining as visually striking.

Besides portraiture, this visual effect can be applied to virtually any other genre of photography, although the contents of the shoot usually determine how well the effect is going to work. What’s more, you don’t need a [professional video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to cartoon a photo, since there are so many websites that let you apply this effect to your photos for free.

That’s why we selected some of the best websites for converting a photo into a cartoon.

## 10+ Best Online Cartoon Photo Makers

[Making cartoons](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) out of photos doesn’t have to be a difficult task that takes a lot of effort to complete. In fact, online cartoon photo makers are easy to use and they don’t require you to have a lot of photo editing experience.

We’ve selected some of the [best online photo editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and photo converters that enable you to cartoon your photos in just a few clicks.

### Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors

You don’t have to purchase an expensive photo editing software if you want to cartoon your photos because there are so many different online photo editing platforms that allow you to apply this effect to your photos for free. Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.

#### 2. BeFunky

Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from **five different cartoonization effects** that are all equally impressive.

All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.

Go to <https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.

#### 3. Lunapic

This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.

Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.

If you want to add cartoon effect to photo with this photo editor, you can go to <https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon>.

#### 4. wish2be cartoon photo editor

If you would like to [turn yourself or your friends into a cartoon character](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Wish2Be cartoon photo editor can be a fun option. The platform’s Free Caricature feature allows you to become a cartoon character in just three easy steps.

You start by customizing the background, selecting the body type, hairstyle, or adding different accessories, gadgets, or even weapons. Once you are done, you can proceed to upload a photo of the person you want to turn into a cartoon character. Optionally, you can add a text layer and adjust its position and size within the picture. If you like the caricature you created, you can buy a print or you can choose to share your design for free. The Pro Cartoonizer feature this platform offers is only available if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.

Here is the website <https://www.wish2be.com/app/cartoon-photo-editor/> for cartoon photos with Wish2Be.

#### 5. SnapsTouch

This is a simple online photo editor that lets you turn your photos into sketches, paintings, or drawings. Choosing the Painting option is probably the easiest way to turn a photo into a cartoon, although this effect can also be achieved with the Pencil Sketch feature.

After you upload a photo you want to turn into a cartoon, you can choose between Painting 1 and Painting 2 options in order to determine the style of the cartoon you’re creating. In addition, you can decide if you want to include the outline in the painting as well as set the size of the brush and how many levels the final image should have. Click on the Paint button and wait for SnapsTouch to generate the cartoonized picture, and you can then proceed to download it to your computer.

To use this online photo editor to cartoon, go to <http://www.snapstouch.com/Painting.aspx>.

### Part 2: 8 Free Online Photo to Cartoon Converters That You Should Try

Converting a photo into a cartoon automates this process, which makes cartoon converters a great option for anyone who finds online photo editing apps difficult to use. Here are some of the best online photo to cartoon converters you can use for free.

#### 1. KusoCartoon

You can cartoon a photo with the photo to cartoon converter even if you never went through this process before. All you need to do is upload the photo to the platform, pick the cartoon style you like and click on the Photo to Cartoon button.

The platform will automatically apply the effect to your photo and display the results after it cartoons the picture. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can change the cartoon style, reduce or increase the number of colors, and adjust the saturation and brightness values. In addition, the platform lets you decide if the lines in the picture are going to be thick or thin or how intense the shadows are going to be.

Convert a photo to cartoon with KusoCartoon: <https://kusocartoon.com/photo-to-cartoon.php>.

#### 2. pho.to

Cartoon is just one out of hundreds of effects the pho.to platform offers. In addition to cartooning a photo, you can also use this platform to retouch portraits, enhance photos automatically, or apply different types of visual effects.

You can upload a photo from your computer, your Facebook profile, or the cloud and the platform will cartoonize it as soon as the upload process is completed. In case you don’t like the results you can click on the Adjustments button and open the image in the pho.to’s editor to enhance its colors or apply stickers. However, all photos you cartooned with this photo to cartoon converter are going to be watermarked if you use its free version.

You can visit <https://funny.pho.to/cartoon/> to turn photos to cartoons with pho.to.

#### 3. Cartoonize.net

You can turn a photo into a cartoon in just a few moments with this platform. Cartoonize.net is going to apply a cartoon effect to a photo you upload automatically, but it also lets you choose from dozens of effects that make photos look like cartoons.

You just have to click on an effect you like in case you don’t like the effect the platform selected for you to apply it. However, you can’t fine-tune the effect’s settings, and some of your photos may not look perfect after you apply a cartoon effect to them. Besides cartooning photos, you can use this platform to perform basic photo editing actions like cropping or rotating, while the platform also offers powerful text tools that enable you to add text layers to photos you cartoon.

To cartoon a photo with Cartoonize.net, go to <https://www.cartoonize.net/>.

#### 4. PhotoCartoon

Creating cartoons from photos with this platform is a fun process anyone can complete. You just have to upload a photo via URL or from your computer and then proceed to choose one of the available cartoon effects.

You can choose from effects like Cartoon, Toon Cloudy, or Watercolor, and you can just click on the one you like to apply it to your photo. In addition, you can also add text to each photo you cartoonize with the platform and choose a font or the size and color of the text.
