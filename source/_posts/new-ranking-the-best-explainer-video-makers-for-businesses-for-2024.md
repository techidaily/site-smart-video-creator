##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The cameras on iPhones and Android phones enable us to capture high-resolution footage with a single tap, but the videos we record with our Smartphones are not always perfect. **Vertical video editing apps** provide a simple solution to these issues, as they allow their users to edit their footage just moments after they recorded it.

The ease of use, the number of available video editing options, or the ease of use are some of the aspects we considered while choosing the vertical video app we included in this article. So, let’s take a look at what the best vertical video apps for iOS and Android devices have to offer.

---

## The Best Vertical Video Apps for iOS and Android Devices

Being able to post content to your social media pages from wherever you go can help you attract a large number of followers. However, in order to do that, you will need a reliable [video editing application](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that has all the tools you need to polish a video and adjust its aspect ratio to the demands of the social media network to which you want to post it. Here are some of the **best vertical video apps** you can find on Google Play or App Store.

Note: The vertical editing apps are listed in no particular order.

### 1. [Quik](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/quik-app-video-photo-editor)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android, iOS

![ Quik Vertical Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quik.JPG)

Content creators that often shoot their videos at outdoor locations with [GoPro cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are going to love using the Quik app because it enables them [to edit their footage](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) while they are on the go. You can combine up to 75 videos and photos, and Quik will analyze them automatically and apply corrections wherever it is needed.

The app also grants you access to more than twenty themes that contain transitions and graphics, so that you can just upload the footage you want to include in a project and Quik will do the rest for you. Each of these themes is fully customizable and you can easily trim a video clip, [alter its playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or set a preferred aspect ratio.

**What We Love About Quik:**

* The automated video editing process
* Voice detection feature

The app’s video editing options are as impressive as its video recording capabilities, since cutting, trimming or merging videos and photos requires a minimum amount of effort.

There are more than fifty video filters available in the app’s effects library while [adding a text overlay to a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) requires only a few taps.
