Avidemux is an open-source and cross platform video editing tool which enables users to edit and linearly organize the video projects. Users can also apply audio and video effects to the media. But sometimes you may come across Avidemux no sound issue after exporting the project, which is really annoying. Want to find a solution? Just read on this article.

If Avidemux has no sound, in most cases this is simply because you didn’t enable the sound yet, because Avidemux’s audio output is set to “DUMMY”by default. To fix it, click on the Tools heading, and select its "Preferences" and then switch to the “Audio”tab. Then change "Audio output" to "WIN32" or whatever suits your OS from the "Audio Device" menu box. Finally click the “OK” button. Now you should hear sound. If you still couldn't hear the sound, then something might be wrong with the codec.
