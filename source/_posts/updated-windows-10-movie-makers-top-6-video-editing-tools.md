#### 4. [GoPro Quik Desktop app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

If you're traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software.

Some good features are paid and expensive

#### 5. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.

**What we like:**

Complete video production tool with audio post-production options

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects.

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

It features the drag-n-drop functions and offers almost all the classic video editing functions including trim, rotate, split, combine as well as adding music track, filters, and themes.

**What we like:**

#### 2. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

**Price:** Free

iMovie is a free video editing software for vloggers who using Mac to edit vidoes. It is equipped with an array of fantastic and practical video editing features, iMovie is an idea video editing tool for anyone. Comes with every new iMac, it's free of charge and provides a wide range of effects and tools sets, thus it's always considered as an essential tool for any Mac user to enhance their vologs.

Despite a somewhat limited scope of video editing features iMovie provides, the software is still powerful enough to enable you to edit footage captured in resolutions up to **4K** . Additionally, you can [create titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [apply visual effects and filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to video clips, or even record your own voiceovers. iMovie’s file sharing capabilities are perfectly suited for vlogging as you can upload a video to your YouTube channel or Facebook account directly from the software.

**What we like:**

The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can **only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.**

**What we like:**

Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool

**What we don’t like:**

Sometimes errors appear when opening the software

#### 4. [GoPro Quik Desktop app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

If you're traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.

**What we like:**

It offers cloud storage

**What we don’t like:**

Some good features are paid and expensive

#### 5. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

**Price:** Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Windows and MacOS

Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.

**What we like:**

Complete video production tool with audio post-production options

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS

Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

**What we don’t like**

No direct download link

Not meant for professional editors

#### 7. [VideoPad](https://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html)

**Price:**  Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Mac and Windows OS

Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.

In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

**What we like:**

The free version includes lots of exciting features

Affordable upgrade

**What we don’t like:**

Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version

Free tech – support
