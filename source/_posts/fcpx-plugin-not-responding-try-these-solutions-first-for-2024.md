Here are a few common reasons due to which your plugin may be working partially or completely crashing.

* Inappropriate configuration or settings of the Final Cut Pro X
* Conflict with the plugin template
* Incorrect code of the plugin by rookie developers
* Incompatibility with the latest version of Final Cut Pro
* Incomplete installation of the plugin

Among the many reasons for plugin malfunction, one of the most common ones in incorrect or bad code. After all, nobody is protected from rookie developers as they can come with strange codes, causing plugin crashing problems. It is not the user’s mistake if the code is incorrect. Therefore, you should simply consider taking advice from the help center of the plugin site or ask any of their experts to settle the matter.

In addition to this, the plugins are constantly updating by the developers therefore users willing to install the latest plugins should first see whether the plugin is compatible with their Final Cut Pro X version or not. If you do not have the latest version of the software, there are chances that the plugin can crash. You should then consider contacting the expert or simply installing the latest version of the plugin that is best supported by the Final Cut Pro X.

If your plugin does not work, it may be likely due to the aforementioned reasons and causes. But fixing this issue is mandatory therefore, in the next section we have covered a few troubleshooting tips to fix plugins that keep crashing or are malfunctioning.

## How to Fix Plugins Not Working in Final Cut Pro X?

![color-finale-2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-color-finale-2.jpg)

Fortunately, there are easy ways to fix the problem when they are not properly working inside the Final Cut Pro X. Generally, the issue can be fixed by simply updating and re-installing the plugin in your system but if that does not work, consider the below checklist of the elements you should consider fixing the problems related to the generators, effects, transitions, and titles inside the Final Cut Pro X.

* **Searching on the Correct Part** \- When looking for the plugin, you should always ensure looking for it in the correct part of the Final Cut Pro X. For instance, if you are looking for the effects, make sure that you are checking them in the effects panel.
* **Proper Installation** \- The next tip that you must consider is the correct and proper installation of the plugin. You should follow the steps of the plugin installation in order to avoid incorrect installation in your Final Cut Pro X.
* **Localization of the Folders** \- Now comes the localization of the folders meaning their placement. You should ensure keeping your motion effects, templates, generators, transitions, and titles folders localized.
* **Placement of the Effects and Transitions** \- While placing your titles and generators, you should ensure that they go on the top of your timeline however the transitions can go in between the two clips on the timeline and the effects can be dropped directly into the video clip.
* **Delete the Plugin from Everywhere** \- You should always consider deleting the plugin from everywhere in your system if it continues to trouble you. Delete it from the finder and trash folders, then re-download, re-install and restart your system.
* **Seek Help from the Plugin Creator** \- If none of the aforementioned tips helps, you should definitely turn to the service provider or the plugin creator who can offer you their expert assistance.

All those video editors who are specifically getting a red warning error sign inside the Final Cut Pro X software should understand that there is a problem with the actual file instead of the plugin. So, try fixing that in the first place.
