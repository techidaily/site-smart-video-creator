## Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?

If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one's website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.

These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.

Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.

* **To avoid file format hurdle**

To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.

Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.

* **Storage Space and File Size Limitations**

How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.

It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that's above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.

* **Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic**

According to [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/), there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it's viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.

How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.

* **Help Upload High-Quality Video**

Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.

To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.

Here are the best sites and their features;

## Best Free Video Hosting Sites/Services/Platforms

A number of sites have been offering video hosting services for free overwhelming. Even though there are restrictions as to the content to upload, you can find all the information you need either as a tutorial, music or graphical representation.

#### 1. Vimeo

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![video hosting service](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-interface.jpg)

Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone's disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It's not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.

File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.

#### 2. YouTube

![free video hosting sites](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-interface.jpg)

With over 500hours of video uploaded to YouTube per minute, 5 billion videos watched every day and at least 1.3 billion registered users, we all can bet it the most popular and preferred video hosting platform. YouTube is owned by Google and is the world's second-ranked social platform with 27.80 Billion monthly visitors.

Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it's one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.

Verify your account and upload videos of any format of up to 128GB. To watch videos free of ads, subscribe for the premium account. As a free unlimited video hosting site, file size and bandwidth are unlimited but videos cannot exceed 15 minutes

#### 3. Wistia>

![private video hosting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wistia-interface.jpg)

Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.

However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.

While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.

#### 4. Dailymotion

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![video hosting platforms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dailymotion-interface.jpg)

With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren't as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn't limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.

However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.

Among the video hosting sites here, this site is less restrictive and easy to share videos to the social media channels. Categorization of the videos offers easy access to ones desired videos.

#### 5. Twitch

Twitch is a video streaming hosting service provider that offers live broadcast shows for gamers. This is the world's top-ranked game video hosting platform with 625.10 million monthly visitors. Twitch TV was launched in 2011 and is owned and managed by Amazon.

#### 6. Vidyard

![online video hosting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidyard-interface.jpg)

Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.

The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans. They include the Pro at $19/Month and come with 20 embedded videos, Starter at $150/Month, Plus at $850/Month and Enterprise at an unspecified amount.

Vidyard offers unlimited bandwidth to its users across all the plans. Whether you are a private, a marketer, professional or an entrepreneur some features meet all your needs. Why is it loved by millions of users? The answer, the easy-to-use dashboard and plenty of features.

#### 7. Google Drive

![video streaming hosting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-drive-video.jpg)

This is part of the large Google family. It is designed for both personal use and business purposes. If you are a first-timer, your new Google Drive account comes with 15GB storage space. Once you've filled the space, upgrade to a paid plan for a bigger space.

Google Drive is the only online video hosting platform that allows you to first save any video file for as long as you want and embeds to your site at any time and anywhere. This site mostly favours professionals working for a multinational company for they can team to work together from the clouds as though in one office.

#### 9. Metacafe

![video hosting sites for business](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/metacafe-interface.jpg)

Search any video category and you'll definitely find it. However, all videos hosted by Metacafe are short and catchy. Other than the three search categories at the top bar-Trending, Latest and Popular- finding the video of your choice is more simplified by the drop-down menu.

## How Filmora Video Editor Can Determine The Success of Your Videos?

As understood from the Anonymous video hosting sites and those made for privates and businesses, one important aspect is the money-making idea.

Every platform emphasizes the quality of a video. Other than how the message is conveyed, images, sounds, light contrasts, and background appearance determine over 75% of the video viewership.

To boost your video viewership before uploading to any video hosting service provider, I recommend the [**Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor.

Whether you want to change the video background colour, add video effects or add trending music, Filmora can really help.

If you are a beginner, don't worry. It's the simplest and easy-to-use video editing tool you'll find the internet. Secondly, there are free tutorials to learn from. Thirdly, the free plan is worth making your videos get thousands of views, shares, and comments in a day.
