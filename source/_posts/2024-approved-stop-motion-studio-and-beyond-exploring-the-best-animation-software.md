**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

In order to start making a reaction video with VSDC, you must first record your reaction to the video and make sure that the video you’re reacting to is saved on your computer’s hard drive. You should then create a new project in VSDC, specify the resolution for the entire project and proceed to import all media files you’re going to need during the video editing process, by selecting the Video option from the Add Object menu.

Place the files on the editor’s timeline so that they are positioned one above the other. The reaction video should occupy the full screen, and you can use the preview window to adjust the size of the reaction video. You should than readjust the on-screen position and the size of the video you’re reacting to, before proceeding to preview the resulting video. In case you like the result you should click on the Export button and choose the output file format and the destination to which the reaction video will be exported.

**Pros**

* No previous video editing experience needed
* Offers a rich selection of transitions and visual effects
* Videos can be exported directly to YouTube from VSDC in resolutions up to 4K
* Offers desktop capturing tools

**Cons**

* Lacks advanced video editing tools
* Outdated interface design

### 3\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, iPhone, iPad

The process of making a reaction video in iMovie isn’t much different from the process of making any other type of video. Before you start working on your new reaction video, you need to make sure that you have all the media files you want you to use in your project. You can then simply import them into iMovie, and place footage of yourself reacting to a video to the timeline. Afterward, you should place the actual video to which you are reacting above or below the video file that contains the footage of your reaction, depending on which video clip you want to use as a background video.

However, the overlaid video is not going to be automatically visible in the preview screen, so you should just click on the Video Overlay Settings and pick the Picture in Picture option. As soon as you select this option the overlay video will become visible in the preview window, where you can adjust its size and position. When ready, you should export your reaction video and upload it to your channel.

**Pros**

* The quick and easy video editing process
* Available to all Mac users for free
* Excellent for inexperienced video editors
* A rich selection of visual effects

**Cons**

* No screen capturing tools
* Audio editing options could be better

### 4\. [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows, Linux

OBS is a [screencasting software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that enables you to create live streams or record all actions you perform on your computer’s screen. After you launch OBS, you should select the For Recording option, and this reaction video maker will optimize the project settings automatically. Once the OBS’ main window loads, you just have to specify the sources from which you want to record the footage. Simply right-click anywhere within the Sources tab, select the Add option and choose the Display Capture setting from the submenu.

You can then repeat the same process to select Audio Output Capture option, in order to record the audio from the video you’re reacting to. Afterward, you should head over to the Add menu once more and add the Video Capture Device to the Sources tab. Optionally, you can readjust the size of each video source in the Preview Window, and hit the Start Recording button.

**Pros**

* Free for PC and Mac users
* Enables users to specify the format of the output video
* Captures videos in HD resolution
* Excellent audio recording features

**Cons**

* OBS crashes easily
* Not aimed at inexperienced users

### 5\. [VegasPro 18](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/)

**Price:** Freemium

**Compatibility:** Windows

Both the video of your reaction and the video to which you are reacting must be recorded before you start editing them in Sony Vegas Pro. Making a reaction video with this video editing software is a relatively easy task that only requires you to position your footage correctly on the timeline.

The video containing your reaction should be below the video you are commenting on so that the second video can be treated as an overlay. Click on the Event Pan/Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video you’re reacting to. When done, you can proceed to sync both videos so that your reactions correspond with the events in the other video. Don’t forget to preview the reaction video you’ve created before exporting it.

**Pros**

* Offers professional video editing tools
* Grants users full control over the footage
* Intuitive and modernly designed interface
* Supports a broad range of output file formats

**Cons**

* Aimed only at professional video editors
* Capturing a computer screen with Sony Vegas Pro is not possible

---

**Conclusion**

In order to gather thousands of views, comments, and likes, every detail in your reaction videos needs to be perfect. Video reaction makers we featured in this article enable you to have complete creative control over the process of making a reaction video.

Among all these above, if you want to go for a free one, I'll say you should go for **OBS.**

If you want to go for a paid one but don't want to pay too much for it, I'll suggest you go for **Filmora**, which provides you several ways to create a reaction video easily on Windows and Mac.

The software is also an excellent alternative for professionals creating content for TV and cinema. The latest version runs natively on M1 chip; you can expect apparent video editing improvements.

New features include transcoding media files automatically when copying or consolidating projects and downloadable user guides. Other highlighted recent features include Smart Conform, stabilization for 360-degree videos, performance improvements with RED and Canon RAW files, Inspector panel improvements, and audio crossfades.

**Price:** $299 (onetime payment, no subscription)

**Pros:**

* Fast and superb performance
* Works perfectly with Apple computers
* 360-degree video and HDR Support
* Multicam support

**Cons:**

* Lacks motion tracking and stabilization for 360-degree videos
* Integration with Adobe software seems problematic

### 2\. Lightworks

Another free video editing software that works as a good replacement for pinnacle studio for Mac is Lightworks. It's packed with many useful features, and although there is paid version, the free version has all the bells and whistles needed for beginners.

However, if you're working with 4K videos for YouTube or Vimeo—you need to get the paid version of Lightworks as this feature isn't available in the free version. The paid version costs $25 a month. The free version includes multi-cam support, high-precision video trimming, video exports at 720p, and support for most video formats.

**Price:** $25/month

**Pros:**

* Has many video tutorials
* Intuitive interface and easy to use
* The free version is ideal for beginners

**Cons:**

* No 4K video support in the free version
* Lacks predefined filters and effects

### 3\. OpenShot

With easy-to-use features, a simple interface, and real-time previews for transitions between clips, unlimited layers, and audio mixing capabilities, OpenShot is one of the top free video editing software around. One of the best things about OpenShot is that its interface allows for easy-to-use drag and drop features. If you're a Mac user and looking for a free, open-source video editor that packs more features than iMovie—OpenShot is a great alternative you can't miss.

With OpenShot's special effects engine, users can modify, reverse, slow up or slow down videos, and preview projects in real-time. Furthermore, other standard features of OpenShot include composition, image overlays, clip resizing, trimming, snapping, scaling, watermarks, video transitions, title templates, creating personalized SVG vector titles, desktop integration, adjusting fonts, colors, 3D animated titles, and more.
