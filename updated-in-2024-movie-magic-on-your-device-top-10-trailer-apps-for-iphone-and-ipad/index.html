Summarizing the highlights of your video in a short twenty to thirty-second trailer is one of the techniques you can use to spark the audience’s attention and ultimately increase the number of views your videos are getting.</p>
<p>Besides the promotional purposes, you can also use trailers to create entertaining short videos in order to have fun with your friends. Fortunately, you don’t need a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suite to perform this task since there are hundreds of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allow you <strong>to create trailers on iPhones and iPads.</strong></p>

In addition, the music you choose as the soundtrack for your trailer needs to match with the visuals and the editing style you opted for. Let’s take a look at the top 10 movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads.</p>
<h3 id="1-iMovie"><a href="#1-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p>All iPhones and iPads offer a free way to edit all videos you record with them. All you need to do is make sure that iMovie is installed on your iPhone or iPad and you can start editing the footage you recorded. In addition, you can also import videos recorded with different types of cameras into iMovie, as long as they are saved in the file format that is compatible with this app.</p>
<p>iMovie offers a variety of predesigned trailer themes, so you just have to pick the one you like the most and then choose the footage you want to include in your trailer. Keep in mind that you cannot add music to any of the trailer themes, but you can export the trailer you created and create the soundtrack from iMovie’s Video mode. What’s more, you can also use this app to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add transitions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, visual effects or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >titles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the trailers you create with iMovie.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Wait for some time until Adobe Premiere Pro analyzes your video clip for Stabilization.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Adjust the ‘’Smoothness’’ parameter of the video clip to modify the overall amount of Stabilization.</p>

Let’s check them out!</p>
<p><strong>1. Consider warp stabilize during shooting:</strong></p>
<p>If you keep in mind the warp stabilizer function while filming your videos or photos, you’ll get rid of fixing problems after the work. So, if you want glossy touch in your shots with zero access to a gimbal, you should consider filming with a faster shutter speed or a wider frame. In this way, you’ll get more convenience while applying the effect in the edit.</p>
<p><strong>2. Modify extra cropping in your footage:</strong></p>
<p>Warp stabilizer is a tool that can provide you stable footage and crop your shot as well. It can crop out the edges of your photos or videos, giving you a smooth and clean shot. To adjust the cropping in your clips, go to advanced settings and then click on Crop less &lt;-&gt; Smooth More Slider.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analyze the effect of Warp stabilizer:</strong></p>
<p>Always check the order of effects in the ‘’Effect Controls’’ folder. If you ever lost some stabilization after editing your shot, ensure not to change the Warp Stabilizer analysis source. Further, you should always re-analyze your clip after a quick color fix.</p>
<p><strong>4. Nest your clips:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we got an error message in the form of a red banner across our footage while trying to modify the speed on <strong>premiere stabilize video</strong>. Basically, we can’t use a Warp stabilizer to alter the speed of the same clip. But no worries! There is an easy fix – click on the altered clip and then click on Nest. Now, you can fix the nested sequence without any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>5. Save your favorite settings as a preset:</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve found a setting that gives you a happy result, you can save it as a preset for future use. In this way, you can speed up your work nicely while working with numerous shaky clips. Also, it can help if you want to make a similar effect to your multiple projects. Moreover, keep in mind that the Warp stabilizer needs to assess each clip frame by frame because it is not a one-size model that can fit all footage. Therefore, remember to click the ‘’Analyze’’ button even after putting the preset to turn it on.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Stabilize-Shaky-Footage-Without-Using-Warp-Stabilizer"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Stabilize-Shaky-Footage-Without-Using-Warp-Stabilizer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?"></a>Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?</h2><p>Sometimes, the shakiness of clips is too extreme, and the Warp Stabilizer effect can’t handle it. Moreover, the filter algorithm incorrectly compensates for the camera moves. So what strategy should apply in this condition? Luckily, there is a method that can be used to stabilize your clips without using a warp stabilizer. Moreover, this process can give a hyper-realistic effect to your footage!</p>
<p><strong>Step1:</strong> Import your clip into Premiere Pro Project and add it to your timeline. Hit on the “clip”, choose “Replace with After Effects Composition” to import the clip.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on the ‘’Tracker panel’’ from the right side of the screen. Scroll down to the ‘’Track Motion’’ option and open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick the tracker marker, drag it to an area of contrasting subject and adjust it accordingly.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Tip: Remember not to make the outer box too large as After Effects can have a hard time performing the track.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Hit the play button in the ‘’Tracker panel’’ to initiate the After Effects. Create a new ‘’Null Object’’ after the tracking process is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Move to the Tracker panel, click on “Edit Target,” choose your “Null Object” and click “OK.”</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Create a new camera and parent it to the null object for applying the stabilization effect to your clips. Enable the 3D option on both the footage layer and the null object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Extend your footage to compensate for any black bars that can occur as the camera pays for the shakiness. That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Shaky footage is almost inescapable once you go handheld.

Let’s check them out!</p>
<p><strong>1. Consider warp stabilize during shooting:</strong></p>
<p>If you keep in mind the warp stabilizer function while filming your videos or photos, you’ll get rid of fixing problems after the work. So, if you want glossy touch in your shots with zero access to a gimbal, you should consider filming with a faster shutter speed or a wider frame. In this way, you’ll get more convenience while applying the effect in the edit.</p>
<p><strong>2. Modify extra cropping in your footage:</strong></p>
<p>Warp stabilizer is a tool that can provide you stable footage and crop your shot as well. It can crop out the edges of your photos or videos, giving you a smooth and clean shot. To adjust the cropping in your clips, go to advanced settings and then click on Crop less &lt;-&gt; Smooth More Slider.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analyze the effect of Warp stabilizer:</strong></p>
<p>Always check the order of effects in the ‘’Effect Controls’’ folder. If you ever lost some stabilization after editing your shot, ensure not to change the Warp Stabilizer analysis source. Further, you should always re-analyze your clip after a quick color fix.</p>
<p><strong>4. Nest your clips:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we got an error message in the form of a red banner across our footage while trying to modify the speed on <strong>premiere stabilize video</strong>. Basically, we can’t use a Warp stabilizer to alter the speed of the same clip. But no worries! There is an easy fix – click on the altered clip and then click on Nest. Now, you can fix the nested sequence without any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>5. Save your favorite settings as a preset:</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve found a setting that gives you a happy result, you can save it as a preset for future use. In this way, you can speed up your work nicely while working with numerous shaky clips. Also, it can help if you want to make a similar effect to your multiple projects. Moreover, keep in mind that the Warp stabilizer needs to assess each clip frame by frame because it is not a one-size model that can fit all footage. Therefore, remember to click the ‘’Analyze’’ button even after putting the preset to turn it on.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Stabilize-Shaky-Footage-Without-Using-Warp-Stabilizer-1"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Stabilize-Shaky-Footage-Without-Using-Warp-Stabilizer-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?"></a>Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?</h2><p>Sometimes, the shakiness of clips is too extreme, and the Warp Stabilizer effect can’t handle it. Moreover, the filter algorithm incorrectly compensates for the camera moves. So what strategy should apply in this condition? Luckily, there is a method that can be used to stabilize your clips without using a warp stabilizer. Moreover, this process can give a hyper-realistic effect to your footage!</p>
<p><strong>Step1:</strong> Import your clip into Premiere Pro Project and add it to your timeline. Hit on the “clip”, choose “Replace with After Effects Composition” to import the clip.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on the ‘’Tracker panel’’ from the right side of the screen. Scroll down to the ‘’Track Motion’’ option and open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick the tracker marker, drag it to an area of contrasting subject and adjust it accordingly.</p>

<p>Tip: Remember not to make the outer box too large as After Effects can have a hard time performing the track.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Hit the play button in the ‘’Tracker panel’’ to initiate the After Effects. Create a new ‘’Null Object’’ after the tracking process is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Move to the Tracker panel, click on “Edit Target,” choose your “Null Object” and click “OK.”</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Create a new camera and parent it to the null object for applying the stabilization effect to your clips. Enable the 3D option on both the footage layer and the null object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Extend your footage to compensate for any black bars that can occur as the camera pays for the shakiness. That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

Let’s check them out!</p>
<p><strong>1. Consider warp stabilize during shooting:</strong></p>
<p>If you keep in mind the warp stabilizer function while filming your videos or photos, you’ll get rid of fixing problems after the work. So, if you want glossy touch in your shots with zero access to a gimbal, you should consider filming with a faster shutter speed or a wider frame. In this way, you’ll get more convenience while applying the effect in the edit.</p>
<p><strong>2. Modify extra cropping in your footage:</strong></p>
<p>Warp stabilizer is a tool that can provide you stable footage and crop your shot as well. It can crop out the edges of your photos or videos, giving you a smooth and clean shot. To adjust the cropping in your clips, go to advanced settings and then click on Crop less &lt;-&gt; Smooth More Slider.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analyze the effect of Warp stabilizer:</strong></p>
<p>Always check the order of effects in the ‘’Effect Controls’’ folder. If you ever lost some stabilization after editing your shot, ensure not to change the Warp Stabilizer analysis source. Further, you should always re-analyze your clip after a quick color fix.</p>
<p><strong>4. Nest your clips:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we got an error message in the form of a red banner across our footage while trying to modify the speed on <strong>premiere stabilize video</strong>. Basically, we can’t use a Warp stabilizer to alter the speed of the same clip. But no worries! There is an easy fix – click on the altered clip and then click on Nest. Now, you can fix the nested sequence without any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>5. Save your favorite settings as a preset:</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve found a setting that gives you a happy result, you can save it as a preset for future use. In this way, you can speed up your work nicely while working with numerous shaky clips. Also, it can help if you want to make a similar effect to your multiple projects. Moreover, keep in mind that the Warp stabilizer needs to assess each clip frame by frame because it is not a one-size model that can fit all footage. Therefore, remember to click the ‘’Analyze’’ button even after putting the preset to turn it on.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Stabilize-Shaky-Footage-Without-Using-Warp-Stabilizer-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Stabilize-Shaky-Footage-Without-Using-Warp-Stabilizer-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?"></a>Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?</h2><p>Sometimes, the shakiness of clips is too extreme, and the Warp Stabilizer effect can’t handle it. Moreover, the filter algorithm incorrectly compensates for the camera moves. So what strategy should apply in this condition? Luckily, there is a method that can be used to stabilize your clips without using a warp stabilizer. Moreover, this process can give a hyper-realistic effect to your footage!</p>
<p><strong>Step1:</strong> Import your clip into Premiere Pro Project and add it to your timeline. Hit on the “clip”, choose “Replace with After Effects Composition” to import the clip.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on the ‘’Tracker panel’’ from the right side of the screen. Scroll down to the ‘’Track Motion’’ option and open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick the tracker marker, drag it to an area of contrasting subject and adjust it accordingly.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="adobe premiere pro track motion"
                ></p>
<p>Tip: Remember not to make the outer box too large as After Effects can have a hard time performing the track.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Hit the play button in the ‘’Tracker panel’’ to initiate the After Effects. Create a new ‘’Null Object’’ after the tracking process is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Move to the Tracker panel, click on “Edit Target,” choose your “Null Object” and click “OK.”</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Create a new camera and parent it to the null object for applying the stabilization effect to your clips. Enable the 3D option on both the footage layer and the null object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Extend your footage to compensate for any black bars that can occur as the camera pays for the shakiness. That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Shaky footage is almost inescapable once you go handheld. If you don’t have a manual stabilizer like a gimbal, a tripod, or a glide cam – your work can fall victim to running, wind, walking, or other elements. In this article, we’ve introduced a quick and fast antidote for shaky footage – a Warp Stabilizer effect in the Adobe Premiere Pro. It can smooth out your shaky photos or videos with just a few clicks. So, do you know how to <strong>stabilize video premiere pro</strong>? Read out the article!</p>
