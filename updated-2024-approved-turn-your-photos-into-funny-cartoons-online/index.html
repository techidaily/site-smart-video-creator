<p>Cartooning a photo is a simple and yet effective way of enhancing a picture and making it more visually appealing. Besides adding an artistic touch to portraits you take, cartooning a photo can also be a great way to have fun with your friends because the results of picture cartooning can be as entertaining as visually striking.</p>
<p>Besides portraiture, this visual effect can be applied to virtually any other genre of photography, although the contents of the shoot usually determine how well the effect is going to work.

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Convert Audio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>How to Convert Audio?</strong></h2><p>Before we start listing the best <strong>audio converters</strong> down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an <strong>audio converter</strong>! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The <strong>free audio converter</strong> that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual ‘launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png"
                      alt="Launch Audio Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Audio File!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to ‘Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the ‘UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png"
                      alt="Upload Audio for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select Audio File Output Format"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Start Conversion!</strong></p>
<p>Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting ‘CONVERT’.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Start conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download or Save File!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion has been completed, your <strong>audio converter</strong> will either give you an option to ‘DOWNLOAD’ or ‘SAVE’ the finished product to your device!</p>

We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Essential Features of Audio Converter Software"></a>Part 3 <strong>Essential Features of Audio Converter Software</strong></h2><p>There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best <strong>audio converter</strong> software for them:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-What’s-the-Best-Free-Audio-Converter-Software-Programs"><a href="#Part-4-What’s-the-Best-Free-Audio-Converter-Software-Programs" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 What’s the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs"></a>Part 4 <strong>What’s the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs</strong></h2><p>Now to get to our list of the best <strong>free audio converter</strong> software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best <strong>audio converter</strong> for each type of user…</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="01**Wondershare Filmora Video Editor**"></a>01**<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**</h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Windows&#x2F;Mac</p>

<p><strong>CNET Rating:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

There are just too many of them! No one has the time to go and test each and every single one of them! (Aside from us!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fortunately, in terms of features, there are really only three that you have to think about: speed, flexibility, and bonus features.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The abundance of choices at least makes sure that each <strong>audio auditor</strong> is able to meet the specific needs of a certain group of users! To imitate this fact, our list of <strong>audio converters</strong> was compiled specifically so that we could offer as much variety as possible. With hints along the way to make sure that everyone has an audio converter that suits their own projects.</p>

<p>We’ve picked out some of the best <strong>audio converters</strong> available right now based on several different factors</p>
<p>You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Convert Audio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>How to Convert Audio?</strong></h2><p>Before we start listing the best <strong>audio converters</strong> down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an <strong>audio converter</strong>! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The <strong>free audio converter</strong> that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual ‘launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!</p>

                      alt="Launch Audio Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Audio File!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to ‘Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the ‘UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png"
                      alt="Upload Audio for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Select Audio File Output Format"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Start Conversion!</strong></p>
<p>Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting ‘CONVERT’.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download or Save File!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion has been completed, your <strong>audio converter</strong> will either give you an option to ‘DOWNLOAD’ or ‘SAVE’ the finished product to your device!</p>

We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-1"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Essential Features of Audio Converter Software"></a>Part 3 <strong>Essential Features of Audio Converter Software</strong></h2><p>There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best <strong>audio converter</strong> software for them:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!</p>

We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best <strong>audio converter</strong> for each type of user…</p>

<p><strong>CNET Rating:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

<p>For the next item on our list, we have EaseUs Video Converter! If Filmora Pro is the jack of all trades, EaseUs Video Converter is the master of its trade. As a converter true and true, it is capable of more advanced conversions. Case in point, the software supports over 300 audio formats (including some of the obscure ones!) It also offers basic video and audio editing for perfecting projects!</p>

With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an <strong>audio converter</strong>! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The <strong>free audio converter</strong> that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual ‘launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Audio File!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to ‘Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the ‘UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.</p>
<p><img

<p>**<strong>Step 4: Start Conversion!</strong></p>

We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-2"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Essential Features of Audio Converter Software"></a>Part 3 <strong>Essential Features of Audio Converter Software</strong></h2><p>There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best <strong>audio converter</strong> software for them:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!</p>

<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

<p>For the next item on our list, we have EaseUs Video Converter! If Filmora Pro is the jack of all trades, EaseUs Video Converter is the master of its trade.

We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-3"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Essential Features of Audio Converter Software"></a>Part 3 <strong>Essential Features of Audio Converter Software</strong></h2><p>There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best <strong>audio converter</strong> software for them:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!</p>

<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

<p>Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don’t support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren’t designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.</p>
<p>These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let’s see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.</p>

Let’s have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote"><a href="#Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.</p>
<h4 id="1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote"><a href="#1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote" class="headerlink" title="1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app’s main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-remote-desktop.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-remote-desktop"
                ></p>
<p>Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you’ve completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-PIN"><a href="#2-Choose-PIN" class="headerlink" title="2.Choose PIN"></a>2.Choose PIN</h4><p>In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn’t go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-pin.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-pin"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Make-Connection"><a href="#3-Make-Connection" class="headerlink" title="3.Make Connection"></a>3.Make Connection</h4><p>In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you’d like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-connection.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-connection"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Optimize-Options"><a href="#4-Optimize-Options" class="headerlink" title="4.Optimize Options"></a>4.Optimize Options</h4><p>Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you’d like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who’d like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn’t offer a direct transfer of files as an option.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine"></a>Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine</h4><p>The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can’t run on ARM powered Chromebooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.</li>
<li>The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-virtual-machine.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-virtual-machine"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you’ve successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you’d like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>Bonus: We highly recommend you to use our Filmora X following the instructions above, we optimized the app for it.</p>

<p>Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don’t support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren’t designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.</p>
<p>These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let’s see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.</p>

Let’s have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-1"><a href="#Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.</p>
<h4 id="1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-1"><a href="#1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-1" class="headerlink" title="1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app’s main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-remote-desktop.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-remote-desktop"
                ></p>
<p>Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you’ve completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-PIN-1"><a href="#2-Choose-PIN-1" class="headerlink" title="2.Choose PIN"></a>2.Choose PIN</h4><p>In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn’t go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.</p>

                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Make-Connection-1"><a href="#3-Make-Connection-1" class="headerlink" title="3.Make Connection"></a>3.Make Connection</h4><p>In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you’d like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="chromebook-connection"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Optimize-Options-1"><a href="#4-Optimize-Options-1" class="headerlink" title="4.Optimize Options"></a>4.Optimize Options</h4><p>Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you’d like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who’d like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn’t offer a direct transfer of files as an option.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine-1"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine"></a>Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine</h4><p>The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can’t run on ARM powered Chromebooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.</li>
<li>The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="chromebook-virtual-machine"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you’ve successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you’d like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>

There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.</p>
<p>These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let’s see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Run-Windows-and-Mac-OS-Video-Editing-Apps-on-Chromebook-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Run-Windows-and-Mac-OS-Video-Editing-Apps-on-Chromebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Run Windows and Mac OS Video Editing Apps on Chromebook"></a>Part 1: How to Run Windows and Mac OS Video Editing Apps on Chromebook</h2><p>As we already mentioned there are two different ways to run Mac and Windows OS video editing apps from your Chromebook, although one method is much less complicated than the other. Let’s have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-3"><a href="#Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.</p>
<h4 id="1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-3"><a href="#1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-3" class="headerlink" title="1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app’s main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-remote-desktop.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-remote-desktop"
                ></p>
<p>Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you’ve completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-PIN-3"><a href="#2-Choose-PIN-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Choose PIN"></a>2.Choose PIN</h4><p>In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn’t go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-pin.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-pin"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Make-Connection-3"><a href="#3-Make-Connection-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Make Connection"></a>3.Make Connection</h4><p>In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you’d like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-connection.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-connection"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Optimize-Options-3"><a href="#4-Optimize-Options-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Optimize Options"></a>4.Optimize Options</h4><p>Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you’d like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who’d like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn’t offer a direct transfer of files as an option.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine-3"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine"></a>Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine</h4><p>The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can’t run on ARM powered Chromebooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.</li>
<li>The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-virtual-machine.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-virtual-machine"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you’ve successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you’d like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>Bonus: We highly recommend you to use our Filmora X following the instructions above, we optimized the app for it.</p>

<p>Do you enjoy the view of movies? Do you find your videos dull and unexciting? How about giving a cinematic look to your videos?</p>
<p>I bet a lot of editors have been there. However, it won’t take you long to find out that movies are quite different from the video you recorded and edited.</p>
<p>No worries, this article explains why there are differences between self-made videos and movies, as well as simple yet detailed steps to make cinematic look videos with FCPX.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Difference-between-a-Cinematic-Look-and-a-Normal-Video"><a href="#Part-1-Difference-between-a-Cinematic-Look-and-a-Normal-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?"></a><strong>Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?</strong></h2><p>The term cinematic is often referred to the black bars or wide-screen frame ratios. Photographers and filmmakers use the term cinematic to describe the look of movies and pictures shot on film.</p>
<p>However, the term has changed its meaning with the advent of digital video and the invention of high-tech devices. With the evolution of the internet across the globe, YouTubers, videographers, and social media influencers have started using this term to describe anything related to cinema and film. In other words, a cinematic look is an unconventional, film-look, and professional appearance of a video that makes a normal clip look elegant and worth watching. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >See the top 10 movies made by FCPX here. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

                ></p>
<p>So, here we draw a line between a normal video and the one with a cinematic look. In the latter, you adjust everything that is directly or indirectly linked to the quality of a video, including but not limited to <strong>colors</strong>, <strong>appearance</strong>, <strong>light</strong>, <strong>motion</strong>, <strong>frame rate</strong>, <strong>composition</strong>, and <strong>camera</strong> <strong>movements</strong>.</p>
<p>Resolution refers to the horizontal pixel count such as 2K (2.2 megapixels) or 4K (8.8 megapixels). Similarly, the frame rate defines the number of individual images or frames being displayed on the TV screen per second. The universally accepted film frame rate is 24 FPS, which is used to make high-definition videos. However, most TV broadcasts and shows are recorded at 30fps. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >See more about FPS here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the advanced video editing tools and applications that have made it easier to capture a cinematic look or make HD cinematic look videos with basic camera setups. If you want to get your desired cinematic look, read the following section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Cinematic-Look-Film-Video-with-FCPX"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Cinematic-Look-Film-Video-with-FCPX" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make a Cinematic Look Film Video with FCPX?"></a>Part 2: How to Make a Cinematic Look Film Video with FCPX?</h2><p>The latest features and user-friendly dashboard of Final Cut Pro X allow users (even beginners) to add effects and increase the aesthetics of their videos. Follow these four simple steps to make a cinematic look high-resolution video with Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: 4K Resolution and Low Frame Rate</strong></p>
<p>To achieve ideal cinematic aesthetics, you need high-quality 4K resolution videos, awesome exposure, the right codec, and lighting. Hence, to start with, capture a high-quality 4K Canon RAW shot with the latest high-tech Canon Log 2 camera. You can also use other devices and choose different codecs and color profiles to get the best color grade.</p>

                      alt="frame-rate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Color Grading and Color Correction</strong></p>
<p>After importing your footage, get ready for color corrections to address issues like conversions for LOG formats through white balance adjustments. Color corrections normalize the color of HD videos into a standard format. Here’s how you can do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Inspector Panel and select the Extended Function</li>
<li>Select the C-Log 2 conversion LUT</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/color-grading.png"
                      alt="color-grading"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Make minor exposure and white balance adjustments as per your scope</li>
<li>Select the Color Wheels and Color Mask features to custom select specific areas and colors</li>
<li>Adjust your color grade according to your requirements</li>
<li>Use Color Masking to improve the shadow’s appearance and warm-up mid-tones</li>
<li>You will get a strong color contrast in your footage.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 3: Use Slow Motion at the Right Timing</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X allows its users to make both constant and variable speed changes without disturbing the audio’s pitch. By using slow-motion effects at the right timing, you can make your videos adorable and give them a cinematic look.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select your video and click on the Retiming button</li>
<li>Tap on the Slow section</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/slow-motion.png"
                      alt="slow-motion"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You will see multiple options to slow down the speed of your clip</li>
<li>The smaller number will slow down your footage</li>
<li>To apply custom retiming amounts, again click on the Retiming button and select the Custom option</li>
<li>Custom the speed of your clip over 100% or less than 100% as you want</li>
<li>After selecting a value, your selected clip will become longer on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adopt Film Grain to Make Film-look Videos</strong></p>
<p>Film grain overlays give your videos vintage and cinematic look. Follow these steps to use these film grains in Final Cut Pro X:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import your footage and film grains downloaded from the internet and layer them into your timeline</li>
<li>Place the film grain on top of your clip</li>
<li>Select the clip and go to the FCPX blend mode dropdown menu located on the top-right of your screen</li>
<li>Click on the Overlay and adjust the opacity of the film grain overlay as required.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Part-3-What-Other-Factors-Contribute-to-Film-Look-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-What-Other-Factors-Contribute-to-Film-Look-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos"></a><strong>Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos</strong></h2><p>While making cinematic-look videos, also considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>Framing</strong></p>
<p>While filming, one must be aware of the emotion to be captured in the frame. For this purpose, follow the “Rule of Thirds,” which means to divide your short into three horizontal and vertical sections and select the third shot to produce some effect.</p>
<p><strong>Tilt Shift</strong></p>
<p>Instead of shooting your clips with a UHD camera, you can add cinematic effect with the Tilt-shift feature by setting the focus of your video. For this purpose, right-click on the video, select Power Tool and check the box with the option Apply Tilt-shift to the clip. Use the slider to adjust the focus.</p>
<p><strong>Background Music</strong></p>
<p>Cinematic clips without background music seem to be unexciting and boring. Adding melodious background music makes your videos look more professional and enjoyable. You can add default music or your favorite music downloaded from the internet by clicking on the Music tab.</p>
<p><strong>Titles and Subtitles</strong></p>
<p>Adding subtitles to your videos can make them understandable for viewers who speak a different language. Click on Text&#x2F;Credit in Filmora and select Subtitles to add subtitles to your video.</p>

Its user-friendly and easy-to-understand interface makes it popular among beginners as well as professionals.

<p>Here’s how you can add a cinematic look to your footage with Filmora.</p>
<p>1, choose <strong>Effect</strong></p>
<p>2, search for “cinematic” or “film”</p>

<p>No worries, this article explains why there are differences between self-made videos and movies, as well as simple yet detailed steps to make cinematic look videos with FCPX.</p>

Photographers and filmmakers use the term cinematic to describe the look of movies and pictures shot on film.</p>
<p>However, the term has changed its meaning with the advent of digital video and the invention of high-tech devices. With the evolution of the internet across the globe, YouTubers, videographers, and social media influencers have started using this term to describe anything related to cinema and film. In other words, a cinematic look is an unconventional, film-look, and professional appearance of a video that makes a normal clip look elegant and worth watching. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >See the top 10 movies made by FCPX here. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<p>So, here we draw a line between a normal video and the one with a cinematic look. In the latter, you adjust everything that is directly or indirectly linked to the quality of a video, including but not limited to <strong>colors</strong>, <strong>appearance</strong>, <strong>light</strong>, <strong>motion</strong>, <strong>frame rate</strong>, <strong>composition</strong>, and <strong>camera</strong> <strong>movements</strong>.</p>
<p>Resolution refers to the horizontal pixel count such as 2K (2.2 megapixels) or 4K (8.8 megapixels). Similarly, the frame rate defines the number of individual images or frames being displayed on the TV screen per second. The universally accepted film frame rate is 24 FPS, which is used to make high-definition videos. However, most TV broadcasts and shows are recorded at 30fps. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >See more about FPS here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Framing</strong></p>
<p>While filming, one must be aware of the emotion to be captured in the frame. For this purpose, follow the “Rule of Thirds,” which means to divide your short into three horizontal and vertical sections and select the third shot to produce some effect.</p>
<p><strong>Tilt Shift</strong></p>
<p>Instead of shooting your clips with a UHD camera, you can add cinematic effect with the Tilt-shift feature by setting the focus of your video.

<p>Do you enjoy the view of movies? Do you find your videos dull and unexciting? How about giving a cinematic look to your videos?</p>
<p>I bet a lot of editors have been there. However, it won’t take you long to find out that movies are quite different from the video you recorded and edited.</p>
<p>No worries, this article explains why there are differences between self-made videos and movies, as well as simple yet detailed steps to make cinematic look videos with FCPX.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Difference-between-a-Cinematic-Look-and-a-Normal-Video-3"><a href="#Part-1-Difference-between-a-Cinematic-Look-and-a-Normal-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?"></a><strong>Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?</strong></h2><p>The term cinematic is often referred to the black bars or wide-screen frame ratios. Photographers and filmmakers use the term cinematic to describe the look of movies and pictures shot on film.</p>
<p>However, the term has changed its meaning with the advent of digital video and the invention of high-tech devices. With the evolution of the internet across the globe, YouTubers, videographers, and social media influencers have started using this term to describe anything related to cinema and film. In other words, a cinematic look is an unconventional, film-look, and professional appearance of a video that makes a normal clip look elegant and worth watching. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >See the top 10 movies made by FCPX here. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

                ></p>
<p>So, here we draw a line between a normal video and the one with a cinematic look. In the latter, you adjust everything that is directly or indirectly linked to the quality of a video, including but not limited to <strong>colors</strong>, <strong>appearance</strong>, <strong>light</strong>, <strong>motion</strong>, <strong>frame rate</strong>, <strong>composition</strong>, and <strong>camera</strong> <strong>movements</strong>.</p>
<p>Resolution refers to the horizontal pixel count such as 2K (2.2 megapixels) or 4K (8.8 megapixels). Similarly, the frame rate defines the number of individual images or frames being displayed on the TV screen per second. The universally accepted film frame rate is 24 FPS, which is used to make high-definition videos. However, most TV broadcasts and shows are recorded at 30fps. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >See more about FPS here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the advanced video editing tools and applications that have made it easier to capture a cinematic look or make HD cinematic look videos with basic camera setups. If you want to get your desired cinematic look, read the following section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Cinematic-Look-Film-Video-with-FCPX-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Cinematic-Look-Film-Video-with-FCPX-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make a Cinematic Look Film Video with FCPX?"></a>Part 2: How to Make a Cinematic Look Film Video with FCPX?</h2><p>The latest features and user-friendly dashboard of Final Cut Pro X allow users (even beginners) to add effects and increase the aesthetics of their videos. Follow these four simple steps to make a cinematic look high-resolution video with Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: 4K Resolution and Low Frame Rate</strong></p>
<p>To achieve ideal cinematic aesthetics, you need high-quality 4K resolution videos, awesome exposure, the right codec, and lighting. Hence, to start with, capture a high-quality 4K Canon RAW shot with the latest high-tech Canon Log 2 camera. You can also use other devices and choose different codecs and color profiles to get the best color grade.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/frame-rate.png"
                      alt="frame-rate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Color Grading and Color Correction</strong></p>
<p>After importing your footage, get ready for color corrections to address issues like conversions for LOG formats through white balance adjustments. Color corrections normalize the color of HD videos into a standard format. Here’s how you can do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Inspector Panel and select the Extended Function</li>
<li>Select the C-Log 2 conversion LUT</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/color-grading.png"
                      alt="color-grading"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Make minor exposure and white balance adjustments as per your scope</li>
<li>Select the Color Wheels and Color Mask features to custom select specific areas and colors</li>
<li>Adjust your color grade according to your requirements</li>
<li>Use Color Masking to improve the shadow’s appearance and warm-up mid-tones</li>
<li>You will get a strong color contrast in your footage.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 3: Use Slow Motion at the Right Timing</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X allows its users to make both constant and variable speed changes without disturbing the audio’s pitch. By using slow-motion effects at the right timing, you can make your videos adorable and give them a cinematic look.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select your video and click on the Retiming button</li>
<li>Tap on the Slow section</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/slow-motion.png"
                      alt="slow-motion"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You will see multiple options to slow down the speed of your clip</li>
<li>The smaller number will slow down your footage</li>
<li>To apply custom retiming amounts, again click on the Retiming button and select the Custom option</li>
<li>Custom the speed of your clip over 100% or less than 100% as you want</li>
<li>After selecting a value, your selected clip will become longer on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adopt Film Grain to Make Film-look Videos</strong></p>
<p>Film grain overlays give your videos vintage and cinematic look. Follow these steps to use these film grains in Final Cut Pro X:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import your footage and film grains downloaded from the internet and layer them into your timeline</li>
<li>Place the film grain on top of your clip</li>
<li>Select the clip and go to the FCPX blend mode dropdown menu located on the top-right of your screen</li>
<li>Click on the Overlay and adjust the opacity of the film grain overlay as required.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Framing</strong></p>
<p>While filming, one must be aware of the emotion to be captured in the frame. For this purpose, follow the “Rule of Thirds,” which means to divide your short into three horizontal and vertical sections and select the third shot to produce some effect.</p>
<p><strong>Tilt Shift</strong></p>
<p>Instead of shooting your clips with a UHD camera, you can add cinematic effect with the Tilt-shift feature by setting the focus of your video. For this purpose, right-click on the video, select Power Tool and check the box with the option Apply Tilt-shift to the clip. Use the slider to adjust the focus.</p>
<p><strong>Background Music</strong></p>
<p>Cinematic clips without background music seem to be unexciting and boring. Adding melodious background music makes your videos look more professional and enjoyable. You can add default music or your favorite music downloaded from the internet by clicking on the Music tab.</p>
<p><strong>Titles and Subtitles</strong></p>
<p>Adding subtitles to your videos can make them understandable for viewers who speak a different language. Click on Text&#x2F;Credit in Filmora and select Subtitles to add subtitles to your video.</p>
