<p>If you are a fan of electronic, noise, and other experimental genres of music that emerged in the early and mid-1990s, then you probably already know what Glitch art is. Those of you who are a bit younger and don’t know the VJ-ing scene well, have probably encountered glitch art through music videos released by bands like The Glitch Mob or Gorrilaz. Even though intentionally creating glitches and distortions that look like they were caused by hardware malfunction used to be a complex and highly technical process, video editing apps that appeared on the market in the last couple of years have made this video technique almost automatic. If you would like to create glitch art, but you’re not sure where to start, you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through the ten <strong>best glitch art video editing apps for iOS and Android</strong>.</p>

GlicthFX’s file-sharing capabilities present you with a number of options as you can post your latest creations on Musical.ly, Facebook, YouTube, and other popular social networks directly from the app. The only downside is that you have to make in-app purchases in order to be able to use all the VHS and glitch effects the app has to offer.</p>

Groovo also features basic video editing tools, so you can remove all parts of the audio or video files you don’t want to share with your friends on social media.

<p>Ariana Grande, Kylie Jenner or Travis Scott are just a few among countless celebrities who are already using this app to take photos or capture videos. Glitché offers a rich selection of real-time photo and video filters you can control even while you’re still recording. There are more than 30 creative tools that let you create VHS style videos or make digital glitches in just a few simple taps, and if you want to edit your photos and videos with a more powerful software you can export your projects to Adobe Creative Cloud. However, you are going to have to make a few in-app purchases if you want to have access to all of the app’s features.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>
<p>There is so much more you can do with this app, besides creating glitch art, because even the free version HYPERSPECTIVE offers a powerful mirroring system and a rich selection of visual effects. In order to be able to record videos for your Instagram stories, you must upgrade to the paid version of the app that lets you capture HD videos and adjust their bitrate. In addition, the app suggests the content you can use as a source of inspiration for your work, so you can never run out of the ideas for your next video. HYPERSPECTIVE’s exporting capabilities, however, leave much to be desired for.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> $1,99</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>
<p>The app offers more than thirty glitches you can use to create different styles of glitch art videos. You can try out different options and once you get the result you like you can export it as a GIF or a short video. However, Glitch Wizard doesn’t offer video editing options, so there isn’t much more you can do with it other than experiment with different glitches. Even so, this app is an excellent choice for all glitch video artists in need of a creative tool that lets them produce amazing visuals effortlessly. Adding the glitchwizard hashtag to your creations can help you become one of the app’s featured artists.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Android</p>
<p>Even though Glitch! is primarily a photo editing app, you can still use it to generate both GIF and MP4 animations. All you have to do in order to create a glitch photo is to select a picture from your phone’s gallery, upload it into the app and choose the effect you like the most. Afterward, you just have to set the X and Y values that determine how many errors your picture is going to contain and proceed to share it on social media. Keep in mind that some of the app’s advanced features have to be purchased before you can use them to create your artwork.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>
<p>Recording glitch art masterpieces is going to become so easy if you install the Glitch Cam because this app provides you with a ridiculous amount of effects you can combine in real time. In addition to stunning glitch effects, the app is also equipped with a VHS Camcorder that lets you make vintage videos that look like they’re recorded in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The best part is that you can export all your creations in full HD resolution and share them to your favorite social networks directly from the app in just a few quick taps.</p>

<p>Before you can start creating a glitch video with KineMaster, you must first install the Anaglyph Slide effect from the app’s Asset Store. Once the effect is installed, you can import the file you’d like to edit and proceed to make cuts, apply transitions or add a voiceover. When you complete all other <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> actions, you should head over to the Effects menu in order to apply the Anaglyph Slide effect to the video. You can then adjust the effect’s settings by assigning new Angle, Speed, and Distance values and that’s it you’ve created a glitch video with KineMaster.</p>

<p>If you are a fan of electronic, noise, and other experimental genres of music that emerged in the early and mid-1990s, then you probably already know what Glitch art is. Those of you who are a bit younger and don’t know the VJ-ing scene well, have probably encountered glitch art through music videos released by bands like The Glitch Mob or Gorrilaz. Even though intentionally creating glitches and distortions that look like they were caused by hardware malfunction used to be a complex and highly technical process, video editing apps that appeared on the market in the last couple of years have made this video technique almost automatic. If you would like to create glitch art, but you’re not sure where to start, you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through the ten <strong>best glitch art video editing apps for iOS and Android</strong>.</p>

<p>Even though Glitch! is primarily a photo editing app, you can still use it to generate both GIF and MP4 animations. All you have to do in order to create a glitch photo is to select a picture from your phone’s gallery, upload it into the app and choose the effect you like the most. Afterward, you just have to set the X and Y values that determine how many errors your picture is going to contain and proceed to share it on social media. Keep in mind that some of the app’s advanced features have to be purchased before you can use them to create your artwork.</p>

<p>If you are a fan of electronic, noise, and other experimental genres of music that emerged in the early and mid-1990s, then you probably already know what Glitch art is. Those of you who are a bit younger and don’t know the VJ-ing scene well, have probably encountered glitch art through music videos released by bands like The Glitch Mob or Gorrilaz. Even though intentionally creating glitches and distortions that look like they were caused by hardware malfunction used to be a complex and highly technical process, video editing apps that appeared on the market in the last couple of years have made this video technique almost automatic. If you would like to create glitch art, but you’re not sure where to start, you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through the ten <strong>best glitch art video editing apps for iOS and Android</strong>.</p>

<p>Even though Glitch! is primarily a photo editing app, you can still use it to generate both GIF and MP4 animations. All you have to do in order to create a glitch photo is to select a picture from your phone’s gallery, upload it into the app and choose the effect you like the most. Afterward, you just have to set the X and Y values that determine how many errors your picture is going to contain and proceed to share it on social media. Keep in mind that some of the app’s advanced features have to be purchased before you can use them to create your artwork.</p>

<p>If you are a fan of electronic, noise, and other experimental genres of music that emerged in the early and mid-1990s, then you probably already know what Glitch art is. Those of you who are a bit younger and don’t know the VJ-ing scene well, have probably encountered glitch art through music videos released by bands like The Glitch Mob or Gorrilaz. Even though intentionally creating glitches and distortions that look like they were caused by hardware malfunction used to be a complex and highly technical process, video editing apps that appeared on the market in the last couple of years have made this video technique almost automatic. If you would like to create glitch art, but you’re not sure where to start, you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through the ten <strong>best glitch art video editing apps for iOS and Android</strong>.</p>

<p>Making music videos with the GlitchFX app is fun and easy since you only have to pick a video you’d like to edit from your phone’s camera roll, choose the song you’d like to use as a soundtrack, and apply a VHS, Glitch, or any other visual effect you like. The app also features Cut and Trim tools that let you remove all parts of the selected video you don’t want to include in the final cut of your glitch art video. GlicthFX’s file-sharing capabilities present you with a number of options as you can post your latest creations on Musical.ly, Facebook, YouTube, and other popular social networks directly from the app. The only downside is that you have to make in-app purchases in order to be able to use all the VHS and glitch effects the app has to offer.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin the procedure, launch Filmora and select <strong>Import Media Files</strong> to load photos and videos.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place the video in the timeline by dragging and dropping it. And now go to the Audio library to choose a music track to fit the video file.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-audio-to-video.jpg"
                      alt="add audio to video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double click the music track in the timeline, you can change the volume, speed, and other settings here.</p>
<p>and then you can add fade-in or fade-out effects to the audio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-music-in-video.jpg"
                      alt="adjust music in video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After you’ve finished editing, you may export the video in any of the 50+ codecs that the application supports.</p>
<h3 id="4-Cyberlink-PowerDirector-365-3"><a href="#4-Cyberlink-PowerDirector-365-3" class="headerlink" title="4  Cyberlink PowerDirector 365"></a>4  Cyberlink PowerDirector 365</h3><p><strong>Supported System</strong>: Windows, MacOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free trial for 30 days</p>
<p>The video editing program PowerDirector from CyberLink bridges the gap between professional editing and user-friendliness. It has frequently been ahead of the curve in terms of support for new formats and techniques.</p>
<p>It also comes with several features that will assist you in creating a great digital movie, complete with transitions, music, and titles. Best of all, it’s simple to use and renders quickly. PowerDirector is the best video editing program on the market.</p>
<p>The new <strong>Smart Fit Audio Duration tool</strong> allows you to change the length of background music in your movie while keeping the style and tempo of the music. When you’re down in the woods of fine-tuning video and audio features, the application’s user interface is about as plain and easy as a tool with such a massive amount of options can be, but it can still be intimidating.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To import audio clips, go to <strong>Import Media Files</strong> and choose to import audio clips straight from your portable hard drive.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Right-click on the song and select <strong>Add to Music Track</strong> or drag the music onto the playlist.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You may choose from a large range of unique background music recordings. Click on the <strong>Media category</strong> in the Media Room to open a drop-down menu, where you’ll discover the <strong>Background Music</strong> selection.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-background-music-cyberlink-powerdirector.jpg"
                      alt="add background music cyberlink powerdirector"
                ></p>
<h3 id="5-Movavi-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#5-Movavi-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="5  Movavi Video Editor"></a>5  Movavi Video Editor</h3><p><strong>Supported System</strong>: Window, macOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free trial</p>
<p>Movavi is a video editing program with a straightforward, user-friendly interface. PiP, chroma-key, titling, adding music to video, basic keyframing, and motion tracking are all included. It isn’t as feature-rich or speedy as some competitors, but it allows you to create appealing work quickly.</p>
<p>It’s time to begin the post-production procedure when your video capture is finished, and your newly obtained film has been safely transferred from your camcorder to a hard disk. You may alter the audio file of your short video in any manner you like with the Movavi video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> From the welcome box, choose to <strong>Create a projec</strong>t in full feature mode. When you’re in the editor, click the <strong>Add Media Files</strong> button to incorporate the video and audio files you want to utilize in your new project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Every file you choose will be instantly placed on the Movavi timeline, with video files will appear on the Video Track and audio files on the <strong>Audio Track</strong>. To eliminate the unnecessary section of the audio file, click the <strong>Split</strong> option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Simply press <strong>Start</strong> and wait for your movie to be exported after selecting the correct video format and setting the destination folder by deciding on the <strong>Save to</strong> section.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Any video without some background soundtrack or any music, in general, appears to be at its 50% percent. Users tend to lose interest soon if they don’t have something playing in the background all the time.</p>
<p>This is why the best Video Editor with Music reviewed in this article will ultimately do everything for you. From editing your videos and pictures, these apps are tailored to provide excellent functionality to any user. Decide on the one you liked based on the features and treat yourself to the best!</p>
