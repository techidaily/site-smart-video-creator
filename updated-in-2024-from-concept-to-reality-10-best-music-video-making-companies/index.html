Work on the below attributes to build a good lower third element. Always remember to keep it simple to obtain the desired outcomes.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The harmony of hues</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The color combinations of your lower third element play a vital factor. Choose the right mix of shades to attract the viewers. Based on the background, use a complementary color to fill your lower third module for a persuasive display. Ensure the combination of hues must not distract the viewers at any cost.</p>
<p>Try different color schemes with Green, Magenta, Orange, and Blue to create a mesmerizing display of the lower third element. You can also use a color picker tool to choose the right combination of colors that match perfectly with the background and typography.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Motion effect</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Thrill your audience by inserting movements with the lower third elements. When you add some motion effect to this module, it adds flavors to your video. Work on this feature in-depth and observe whether the lower third’s motion effect excites the audience. Customize the animation time, style, and the way it flashes on the screen.</p>
<p>Make the movements simple and do not add too many moves which distract the viewers. Decide how long the animation should play and align the texts and other related elements according to obtain a perfect look. With the perfect text movements, you can draw the attention of the viewers in no time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fonts</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The next crucial factor associated with the lower third element is fonts. Font size, the style creates an impact on the overall design of a lower third module.</p>
<p>If you concentrate on this attribute, you will surely end up with a professional design. Choose the font style and sine according to the background content. Do not overshadow the lower third element with the playing content, instead try to add value to it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Right timing of showing up</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, you must sense the time for the module to turn up on the video. The timing factor contributes a lot to the perfect display of the lower third element.</p>
<p>Set the right time for the element to enter the screen. Decide the enter and exit timing attribute for this element to reach the audience in a better way.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Logos and positions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Position the element at the perfect place on the screen to ensure its visibility. You can also insert your logos along with the texts to enhance your brand.</p>
<p>Proper alignment and the best coordinates on the screen make the lower third module shine better in your video. Proper placement of this element decides the impact on it.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Before you open Cloud Stop Motion and start clicking pictures of your subject for your video, it is important to have a story in mind. So, create a storyboard to break down your stop motion video. You can sketch your plan frame by frame or write bulleted list of your frames. It will help you create your project efficiently, ensuring that you have taken pictures of all the frames that you need to tell your story.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding new project on cloud stop motion"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="allowing access to camera on cloud stop motion"
                ></p>
<p>On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.</p>
<p>Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don’t own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.</p>
<p>Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.</p>
<p>Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion’s gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.</p>
<p>Step 4: Click on play button to preview your project and see if your motion picture turned out as per your liking or not. If you do not like something, go back and make changes. Once done, download your video from cloudstop motion.</p>

If you don’t own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.</p>
<p>Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Before you open Cloud Stop Motion and start clicking pictures of your subject for your video, it is important to have a story in mind. So, create a storyboard to break down your stop motion video. You can sketch your plan frame by frame or write bulleted list of your frames. It will help you create your project efficiently, ensuring that you have taken pictures of all the frames that you need to tell your story.</p>

<p>On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.</p>

VSDC Free Video Editor"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor" >VSDC Free Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes errors appear when opening the software</p>
<h4 id="4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app"><a href="#4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app" class="headerlink" title="4.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>
<h4 id="5-DaVinci-Resolve"><a href="#5-DaVinci-Resolve" class="headerlink" title="5. DaVinci Resolve"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" >DaVinci Resolve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free and premium version</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>
<h4 id="6-VN-Video-Editor"><a href="#6-VN-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="6. VN Video Editor"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vlognow.me/" >VN Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>
<h4 id="7-VideoPad"><a href="#7-VideoPad" class="headerlink" title="7.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>
<h4 id="8-VideoProc-Vlogger"><a href="#8-VideoProc-Vlogger" class="headerlink" title="8.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>100% secure</p>
<p>Free tech – support</p>
<p>Video tutorials available</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Minor issues with clips splitting</p>

A broad spectrum of video editing options grants you the creative freedom to visualize any idea, regardless of how complex that idea may be.

The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the simple editing version comes with essential features, which are also best for quick vlog editing. So if you’re in a hurry and need to upload videos to your channel daily, you can use the simple mode.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes errors appear when opening the software</p>
<h4 id="4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app-2"><a href="#4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>
<h4 id="5-DaVinci-Resolve-2"><a href="#5-DaVinci-Resolve-2" class="headerlink" title="5. DaVinci Resolve"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" >DaVinci Resolve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free and premium version</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>
<h4 id="6-VN-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#6-VN-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="6. VN Video Editor"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vlognow.me/" >VN Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>
<h4 id="7-VideoPad-2"><a href="#7-VideoPad-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>
<h4 id="8-VideoProc-Vlogger-2"><a href="#8-VideoProc-Vlogger-2" class="headerlink" title="8.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>100% secure</p>
<p>Free tech – support</p>
<p>Video tutorials available</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Minor issues with clips splitting</p>

<p>Windows Movie Maker used to be bundled with the Windows operating system and has been assisting amateurs for a very long time. It features the drag-n-drop functions and offers almost all the classic video editing functions including trim, rotate, split, combine as well as adding music track, filters, and themes.

The   <strong>newcomers</strong>  to the world of vlogging can use this software to put several video clips together or to perform basic video editing actions like cutting or trimming.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>
<h4 id="5-DaVinci-Resolve-3"><a href="#5-DaVinci-Resolve-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>100% secure</p>
<p>Free tech – support</p>
<p>Video tutorials available</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
