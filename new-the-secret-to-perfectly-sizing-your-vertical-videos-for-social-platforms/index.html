                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Screen splitting</p>
<p>Multiple clips that are horizontal can be placed at the top of each other for a vertical frame as it is tall. The stacking can be done for the related clips or to make them appear as one. Place the clips creatively using patterns or lines.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Screen Splitting"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Filling the vertical space</p>
<p>If needed, you can creatively fill the vertical space when the shot is not a close one. One of the ideas is by raising the camera of your phone high and then moving it down that will give a deep frame. You can also fill up the vertical space below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Side-to-side fast movements must be avoided</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Avoid Side To Side Fast Movements"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make use of text and graphics</p>
<p>To complement videos, using text and graphics is a good option. Use the vertical space smartly and include text, stickers, graphics, and other content for enhancing the video and its meaning.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Use Text and Graphics"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Grab attention</p>
<p>It is important for the videos on the social media sites to instantly catch the attention of the viewers, else they will move on to the next one.

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rule of Thirds</p>
<p>As per the photography rule of thirds, the main subject is not to be placed at the center and instead it the entire frame is divided into thirds using imaginary horizontal and vertical lines. The subject should be placed on these lines or where the lines meet. Use the guide grid on your phone’s camera to use this rule.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Screen splitting</p>
<p>Multiple clips that are horizontal can be placed at the top of each other for a vertical frame as it is tall. The stacking can be done for the related clips or to make them appear as one. Place the clips creatively using patterns or lines.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Avoid Side To Side Fast Movements"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make use of text and graphics</p>
<p>To complement videos, using text and graphics is a good option. Use the vertical space smartly and include text, stickers, graphics, and other content for enhancing the video and its meaning.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Grab attention</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rule of Thirds</p>

<p>Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image&#x2F;video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.</p>
<p>Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.</p>
<p>It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie’s transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Save It with File Manager</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone’s storage.</p>
<p>Step 2: Open your <strong>File Manager app</strong>. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.</p>

<p> Step 3: On the next screen of Settings, you can enable the option of show hidden files. Go to the internal storage of the device.</p>

                      alt="file manager whatsapp statuses"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-WhatsApp-Status-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-WhatsApp-Status-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is WhatsApp Status?"></a>Part 1: What is WhatsApp Status?</h2><p>WhatsApp is a messaging application that allows you to interact with friends and family members all around the world in real-time. Contacts can see your current location and if you are online at any given time.</p>
<p>Sending free messages to contacts all over the world is made possible through the usage of WiFi or a network connection using WhatsApp. In WhatsApp, you may set a status, which informs your relatives and friends about your whereabouts and whether or not you are online so that they can view the messages.</p>
<p>WhatsApp Status is a status update that is only visible for 24 hours after it is uploaded. You can send pictures, videos, text, links, and animated GIFs to other people. Knowing how to use Instagram Stories will make you feel right at home in no time at all. WhatsApp Status is activated only between two people, who have each other’s contact information saved in their address books; this happens by default. Your Status message will not be seen by anyone if you do not have their phone number saved in your contacts.</p>

<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>

<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>Answer: The Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes full versions of each software similar to the apps or games you normally download or buy through the App Store. As of now, the bundle and its apps have unlimited ownership and access.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can I update apps in the education bundle?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes. Go to Finder &gt; App Store. Type any app in the bundle, for example, Final Cut Pro, in the search bar. In the search results. Locate the app, and if Apple released an update for Final Cut Pro, there would be an ‘Update’ button. Click it, and the app will be updated.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can I download the pro app bundle on PC?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Unfortunately, no. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education is only available for MacBooks, iMacs, Mac Pros, and Mac Minis. Apple has not released or will never make their proprietary software for Windows and other platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can I buy the bundle with friends because I don’t need all the apps?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The Pro Apps Bundle for Education is delivered to you in an email as a list of unique redemption codes for each software. One of the major issues associated with purchasing Apple professional software (such as Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio) is that the license isn’t transferable. Your purchase can only be moved from one personal Mac to another—not given away or combined with someone else’s ID. Once you buy it, your Apple ID will forever stay attached to this product, and all its limitations are yours as well.</p>
