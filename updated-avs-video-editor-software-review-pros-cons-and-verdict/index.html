<p>If you open AVS Video Editor for the first time, you’ll notice that it shares many features with other editing software. Files can be dragged and dropped directly into the program or imported from other sources, such as your desktop or cloud storage. The camera can also capture media directly from the clipboard and even the desktop screen can be captured.</p>
<p>The timeline displays several buttons for different functions once the media is loaded. A clip can be trimmed, enhanced with a filter, and text or music can be added.</p>
<p>You can add a variety of effects to your videos using AVS Video Editor, which makes it stand out from other video editing software. There are thousands of preset transitions and visual filters available for use within the program once you’ve opened a clip. Audio and brightness adjustments can also be made.</p>
<p>Other video editing software does not offer the same features as this one. AVS Video Editor, for example, allows you to add watermarks and overlays to videos without any lag time or loss in quality, which would be impossible with other programs.</p>
<p>The animated logos and text in the video are another great feature. Adding an intro or outro to the end of your video will give it that professional touch before you publish it on YouTube.</p>

<p>The effect that comes up after adding two or more screens in a single frame is called split screen, and the tool that enables the users to do this is a <strong>split screen video editor</strong>.

<p>To brighten the video, on your smartphone, open the Chromic Video Editor. To add a video to the display, choose it. Adjust the brightness of the video by tapping on the Sun symbol. While you’re at it, you may also change the colors and other settings.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Brighten-a-Video-on-Your-iPhone-Before-or-While-Recording-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Brighten-a-Video-on-Your-iPhone-Before-or-While-Recording-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Brighten a Video on Your iPhone Before or While Recording"></a>Part 2: How to Brighten a Video on Your iPhone Before or While Recording</h2><p>A gloomy video isn’t fun to watch, but it’s frequently difficult to know in the present if the video you’re capturing is too dull to see clearly.</p>
<p>Brightening an iPhone video can help you see the activity on-screen and make it more appealing if you share it on social media or post it to a website.</p>
<p>Because the iPhone’s built-in camera app does not enable you to brighten films after they have been recorded, you should always try to light a video before you begin recording.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Switch to video mode by opening the camera app and swiping left. Touch the screen to bring up a box with a sun-shaped symbol.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Move your fingers upward on the iPhone screen to brighten the scene when you begin filming. This may be done at any moment while the video is being recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of <strong>Video Brightening Editor Apps</strong> that will make brightening the videos after filming quite easy for you. Long gone are the days when you had to re-film now and again until you would get that one final shot that has every color adjustment aspect fit to perfection. With the advent of amazing software such as those covered in this article, brightening a dark video has never been easier!</p>
