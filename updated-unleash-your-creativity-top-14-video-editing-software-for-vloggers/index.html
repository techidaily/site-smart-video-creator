The   <strong>newcomers</strong>  to the world of vlogging can use this software to put several video clips together or to perform basic video editing actions like cutting or trimming. Windows Movie Maker never had much to offer to skilled video editors, so if you take vlogging seriously, you won’t spend too much time editing your videos with it.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>

<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>

<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>

Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>
<h4 id="5-DaVinci-Resolve-1"><a href="#5-DaVinci-Resolve-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>
<h4 id="6-VN-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#6-VN-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="6.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>

<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>

Additionally, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create titles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >apply visual effects and filters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to video clips, or even record your own voiceovers. iMovie’s file sharing capabilities are perfectly suited for vlogging as you can upload a video to your YouTube channel or Facebook account directly from the software.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes errors appear when opening the software</p>
<h4 id="4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app-2"><a href="#4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>
<h4 id="5-DaVinci-Resolve-2"><a href="#5-DaVinci-Resolve-2" class="headerlink" title="5. DaVinci Resolve"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" >DaVinci Resolve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free and premium version</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>
<h4 id="6-VN-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#6-VN-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="6. VN Video Editor"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vlognow.me/" >VN Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>
<h4 id="7-VideoPad-2"><a href="#7-VideoPad-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>
<h4 id="8-VideoProc-Vlogger-2"><a href="#8-VideoProc-Vlogger-2" class="headerlink" title="8.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>100% secure</p>
<p>Free tech – support</p>
<p>Video tutorials available</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Minor issues with clips splitting</p>

Additionally, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create titles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >apply visual effects and filters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to video clips, or even record your own voiceovers. iMovie’s file sharing capabilities are perfectly suited for vlogging as you can upload a video to your YouTube channel or Facebook account directly from the software.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Totally free for Mac users and you can also use it on iPhone or iPad to edit vlog videos</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Limited features and effects</p>
<p>Only for Mac or iOS users</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes errors appear when opening the software</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>

It offers different almost all the video editing features and options you can imagine, such as multi-cam synchronization support, batch sequence capture as well as third-party plug-in support.

<p>On the contrary, the simple editing version comes with essential features, which are also best for quick vlog editing. So if you’re in a hurry and need to upload videos to your channel daily, you can use the simple mode.</p>
