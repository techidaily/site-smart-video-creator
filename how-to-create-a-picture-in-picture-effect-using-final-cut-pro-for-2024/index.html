<p>Sometimes we need to show two videos together on the same screen to convey certain usage information. If you are searching for a tool to make this task possible then Final Cut Pro is the best choice for you.</p>
<p>This tool can help you to use the picture-in-picture effect with ease. However, the process for adding this effect cannot be completed within one r two steps.</p>
<p>The article below contains complete details about how to add PIP effects using Final Cut Pro. You will be glad to know that FCP also works with few integrated plugins that assist in the free picture in picture effect generation.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Create-PIP-Effect-with-FCP"><a href="#How-to-Create-PIP-Effect-with-FCP" class="headerlink" title="How to Create PIP Effect with FCP"></a>How to Create PIP Effect with FCP</h2><p>If you are ready with two videos and now want to bring them to the same screen then prefer to follow these simple steps:</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Add-Background-video"><a href="#Step-1-Add-Background-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Add Background video"></a>Step 1: Add Background video</h4><p>The very first step that you need to follow for PIP effect generation using FCP is to bring your main or background video to the timeline as a primary storyline. Once you have created the primary storyline then all videos for the PIP effect will be added to it.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add pip video"
                ></p>
<h4 id="Step-2-Add-PIP-videos"><a href="#Step-2-Add-PIP-videos" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add PIP videos"></a>Step 2: Add PIP videos</h4><p>It is time to choose the higher video clip so that the PIP effect can be applied. This task can be done either by using on-screen type controls available on the viewer or you can move ahead with transform controls available on the inspector.</p>
<p>Note that lower clips use to stay in the background in final results whereas upper clips will appear in the foreground. By default, both clips use to have 100% full screen with 100% opaque settings.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-Apply-PIP-effect"><a href="#Step-3-Apply-PIP-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Apply PIP effect"></a>Step 3: Apply PIP effect</h4><p>As now you have added both videos on-screen now you have to select the higher video and then click over the rectangular transform button that is available on the lower-left corner of viewer screen. As soon as you make this selection, the icon will turn into blue color, and naturally 8 dots will appear around the selected image or video. Use any one of these dots for scaling your selection in asymmetrical order.</p>

<h4 id="Step-4-Adjust-PIP-Effect"><a href="#Step-4-Adjust-PIP-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Adjust PIP Effect"></a>Step 4: Adjust PIP Effect</h4><ul>
<li>If you want to scale this image in a symmetrical fashion then simply drag the dot to the corner from the central position.</li>
<li>Now hold the option key and drag one dot to the corner. It will help you to shrink as well as to enlarge the image even without affecting its actual aspect ratio.</li>
<li>Users can keep on scaling this foreground image till the time they achieve essential size.</li>
<li>Now click inside your selected image and start dragging it to reach a certain specific position. You can place it anywhere on a big screen.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Step-5-Follow-precise-Adjustment"><a href="#Step-5-Follow-precise-Adjustment" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Follow precise Adjustment"></a>Step 5: Follow precise Adjustment</h4><p>Simply select the top clip and then hit Command + 4 to open the inspector. Now click on that blue show button over your FCP screen and it will provide you complete information about the transform category of available built-in effects. If you use inspector for this task then it can help you to get very precise results for scaling needs. It assists users to manage images with accurate position and size.</p>

<li>Now choose the leading edge of effect and use Command + T. It will immediately apply the default cross-dissolve option for starting clip.</li>
<li>You will be glad to know that the PIP effect does not restrict users to work just upon a single image rather it can be used to process as many pictures as your project needs and that can fit inside the frame.</li>

<p>Sometimes we need to show two videos together on the same screen to convey certain usage information. If you are searching for a tool to make this task possible then Final Cut Pro is the best choice for you.</p>
<p>This tool can help you to use the picture-in-picture effect with ease. However, the process for adding this effect cannot be completed within one r two steps.</p>
<p>The article below contains complete details about how to add PIP effects using Final Cut Pro. You will be glad to know that FCP also works with few integrated plugins that assist in the free picture in picture effect generation.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Create-PIP-Effect-with-FCP-1"><a href="#How-to-Create-PIP-Effect-with-FCP-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Create PIP Effect with FCP"></a>How to Create PIP Effect with FCP</h2><p>If you are ready with two videos and now want to bring them to the same screen then prefer to follow these simple steps:</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Add-Background-video-1"><a href="#Step-1-Add-Background-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Add Background video"></a>Step 1: Add Background video</h4><p>The very first step that you need to follow for PIP effect generation using FCP is to bring your main or background video to the timeline as a primary storyline. Once you have created the primary storyline then all videos for the PIP effect will be added to it.</p>
<p><img

<h4 id="Step-2-Add-PIP-videos-1"><a href="#Step-2-Add-PIP-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add PIP videos"></a>Step 2: Add PIP videos</h4><p>It is time to choose the higher video clip so that the PIP effect can be applied. This task can be done either by using on-screen type controls available on the viewer or you can move ahead with transform controls available on the inspector.</p>
<p>Note that lower clips use to stay in the background in final results whereas upper clips will appear in the foreground. By default, both clips use to have 100% full screen with 100% opaque settings.</p>

As soon as you make this selection, the icon will turn into blue color, and naturally 8 dots will appear around the selected image or video. Use any one of these dots for scaling your selection in asymmetrical order.</p>

<li>Now hold the option key and drag one dot to the corner. It will help you to shrink as well as to enlarge the image even without affecting its actual aspect ratio.</li>
<li>Users can keep on scaling this foreground image till the time they achieve essential size.</li>
<li>Now click inside your selected image and start dragging it to reach a certain specific position. You can place it anywhere on a big screen.</li>
