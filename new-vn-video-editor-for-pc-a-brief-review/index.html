<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

                      alt="pro-apps"
                ></p>
<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>Answer: The Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes full versions of each software similar to the apps or games you normally download or buy through the App Store. As of now, the bundle and its apps have unlimited ownership and access.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can I update apps in the education bundle?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question: Can I download the pro app bundle on PC?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Unfortunately, no. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education is only available for MacBooks, iMacs, Mac Pros, and Mac Minis. Apple has not released or will never make their proprietary software for Windows and other platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can I buy the bundle with friends because I don’t need all the apps?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The Pro Apps Bundle for Education is delivered to you in an email as a list of unique redemption codes for each software.

Your purchase can only be moved from one personal Mac to another—not given away or combined with someone else’s ID. Once you buy it, your Apple ID will forever stay attached to this product, and all its limitations are yours as well.</p>
