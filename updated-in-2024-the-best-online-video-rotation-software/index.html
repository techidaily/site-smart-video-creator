<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan" class="headerlink" title="1.

This cross-platform app can be used on Macs, PCs, Linux computers and Smartphones to play different types of audio, image and video files. In fact, VLC is probably the most reliable <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >DVD player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can find, as it allows you to play DVD and Blu-ray discs effortlessly. However, if you want to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >watch videos in 4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or 8K resolution, you must install the VLC 3.0 Vetinari update of the media player.</p>
<p>What’s more, playing a DVD or a Blu-ray with VLC is a simple task you can complete in just a few clicks. The Open Disc option that is located in the player’s Media menu enables you to choose if you would like to open a DVD, VCD, Audio CD or Blu-ray disc. Moreover, you won’t need to install additional  or MPEG-4 codecs, since VLC can play the vast majority of video files regardless of the codec they are using.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Available to all PC and Mac users for free</li>
<li>The most versatile media player on the market</li>
<li>Offers basic video editing options</li>
<li>Powerful subtitle syncing tools</li>

<p> Instagram’s announcement that the stop motion feature will become available in the Stories section created quite a buzz on the Internet, a while ago. In 2020, the feature remains relatively unknown to social media users, even though on paper it seemed promising.</p>
<p> Stop motion videos, are simply sequentially taken photos that create an illusion of movement once they are played one after the other. These <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are growing more popular on social media, as they can make Instagram stories or any other social media feed more interesting.

After you launch the app, you should tap on the <strong>Camera</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the screen. The new window will open where you can choose the type of Instagram story you want to create, so you can pick to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >go live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, record a video normally or use the app’s Boomerang feature.</p>
<p> You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.</p>
<p> Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created.

<p> Instagram’s announcement that the stop motion feature will become available in the Stories section created quite a buzz on the Internet, a while ago. In 2020, the feature remains relatively unknown to social media users, even though on paper it seemed promising.</p>
<p> Stop motion videos, are simply sequentially taken photos that create an illusion of movement once they are played one after the other. These <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are growing more popular on social media, as they can make Instagram stories or any other social media feed more interesting. You are at the right place if you would like to join video content creators who already <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >produce stop motion videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because in this article we are going to show you how to make a stop motion video on Instagram.</p>

After you launch the app, you should tap on the <strong>Camera</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the screen. The new window will open where you can choose the type of Instagram story you want to create, so you can pick to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >go live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, record a video normally or use the app’s Boomerang feature.</p>
<p> You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.</p>
<p> Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created. Press the Send To button and decide if you want to share the stop motion video to your Instagram or Facebook story or with some of your Instagram followers. ;</p>

<p>As per research, audio plays a more vital role than the visuals in a video. Yes, no one will ever like a video that gets the audio track unrelated to the moving clip or has no voice. Similarly, suppose you are shooting or recording a live video. In that case, the most off-putting factors like <strong>background noise</strong>, <strong>improper microphone</strong>, and various distractions from the environment can affect the video or the movie quality.</p>
<p>Even if you perform recording in a proper studio, slight background noise can sneak into your video. So, tuning the voice or removing it is mandatory. If you are a Mac user, you can use the FCP noise removal to accomplish the task with no other third-party assistance. Please take a look at our today’s article to know <strong>how to get rid of background noise in Final Cut Pro</strong>. Alongside, you can also get to know some noise reduction plugins for FCPX.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Remove-Background-Noise-from-Audio-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Remove-Background-Noise-from-Audio-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Remove Background Noise from Audio in Final Cut Pro X?"></a>Part 1: How to Remove Background Noise from Audio in Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>Want to know how to remove background noise in Final Cut Pro X? Here is a step-by-step guide for you to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start new project &amp; import files</strong></p>
<p>Once you have launched the Final Cut Pro X application on your Mac device, go to “File &gt; New &gt; Project”.</p>
<p>Name the project and customize the video on the following pop-up window. You can then import the video files by executing “File &gt; Import &gt; Media”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Click the audio Enhancer option</strong></p>
<p>Now, take the video onto the timeline and execute “Modify &gt; Auto Enhance Audio” from the top menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut “Command-A.”</p>
<p>On the options above the timeline, tap the “Magic” icon, and from the drop-down, you can choose the <strong>Auto Enhancer Audio</strong> option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="audio-enhance"
                ></p>
<p>You will also see another option to open an audio enhancer, which you can accomplish by clicking the <strong>Audio</strong> icon, which you can find above the <strong>Preview</strong> screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Customize the Audio inspector</strong></p>
<p>You will now get an audio enhancer or inspector toolbox on the right of the screen from where you can optimize or configure various options like equalization adjustments, loudness settings, noise removal, and hum removal.</p>
<p>Using FCP noise removal is so easy. And to remove background noise in Final Cut Pro X, you need to enable the <strong>Noise Removal</strong> checkbox and slide the pointer to a particular level. That is how to remove background noise in FCPX at ease.</p>
<p>Another exciting option offered for Mac users is hum removal in Final Cut Pro. Yes, under the audio enhancement window, you have a separate checkbox for hum removal where you can select either option of 50Hz or 60Hz.</p>
